0	Exodus	"Culture of honor, culture of shame
Imprisoned by the burqa
Her innocence to blame
Sharia law and the almighty Allah
Rule with the whip in hand
Divine decree alliance against women
Throughout the holy land

Buried alive, burned, mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated
Beg for mercy with no avail
Muslim teachings must prevail

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Father slays daughter
A husband his wife
A mother is killed by her son
Cut from the womb
Bastard infant is strangled
A page from the holy Quran
Honor killers, moral vigilantes
Wipe away the stain of shame
To protect the family honor
And restore the family name

Buried alive, burned, mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated
Beg for mercy with no avail
Muslim teachings must prevail

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Heed obey! Get on your knees and pray
Heed obey! Five times a day
Heed obey! Get on your knees and pray
Heed obey! Five times a day
We put thee on the path, so follow it
And follow not the whims of those who know not
Heed obey! Get on your knees and pray
Heed obey! A tortured body on display

Segregation discrimination female genital mutilation
Subordination banned from education
Actions and sayings of the first three generations
Forced into marriage against her own will
Dowry and bride price to seal the deal
Left to rot in solitude
Suicide is the only substitute

Buried alive burned mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated
Beaten tortured ostracized accused of being westernized

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation"
1	Exodus	"My angel in anger, keep me drunk with wrath
Hatred, my light upon my chosen path
No concern about the aftermath
No trepidation
The binds are broken, hold me back no more
Twisted fantasies I shall soon explore
Black angel walk with me forevermore
Begin my transformation

Divinity of death divine
Mercy withers on the vine
Pulse rushes, I'm set free from my cage
I no longer walk alone
Make her animosity my own
Crushing embrace
I'm wrapped in the arms of rage

Agitation is my patron lord
Miscreant seraphim of all abhorred
Her admiration is my just reward
My coronation
Delirium through her sweet caress
Heed her words, I never second-guess
Symphony of malice played at my request
Her proclamation

Divinity of death divine
Mercy withers on the vine
Pulse rushes, I'm set free from my cage
I no longer walk alone
Make her animosity my own
Crushing embrace
I'm wrapped in the arms of rage"
2	Exodus	"It starts with life, a way to live
I love the sound of pain
The more it hurts the better I feel
The world will fall insane
It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

[Chorus]
Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

[Chorus]

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine
I tell you all it's the way to live
Get stronger on death glory
Infringing on sacrificial rites
Death's your final story

[Chorus]"
3	Exodus	"Come into my home
Black master rules the night
See the power start to surge
Upon a hellish sight
It's time to raise them up
Up from below the grave
White bones glow savagery
Provide the light we crave

[Chorus]
Turn to look at Baphomet
From below and not above
Welcome to my sacrifice
Tonight there'll be no love

The darkness is my lover
She makes he feel strong
Take what I want, when I want
At night I do no wrong
When I walk the streets
Got Loki on my side
Slit your throat, drink your blood
Who cares when others die

[Chorus]

You thought you'd live for oh 50 long
Now it's your turn to die
Live with Satan down in Hell
Born to forever cry
Took your life I don't feel bad
Born to live in hell
Died for nothing, slow decay
Your body starts to smell"
4	Exodus	"A distant hum
Cuts right through the skies
Calling my attention I look up
I can't believe my eyes
Thousands and thousands
Hungry for our minds
They're biting, eating and controlling
Anything they find

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]
Run-but you can't hide
Blood-coming from inside
My mind-doesn't know wrong from right
Parasite!

A million more
Coming after me
They thrive on insecticide
They live on DDT
No poison can defeat
The never ending swarm
They'll eat you from inside out
You'll wish you were never born

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]

Run-but you can't hide
Blood-sucked from inside
My mind-doesn't know wrong from right
Parasite!

Now they're living in my brain
I'm destroying at their cue
A violent reaction starts within
And now I'm after you!
I'll grab you by your head
And split your skull open wide
The infestation in complete
You're dead but yet alive!

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]"
5	Exodus	"Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you
Die!

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

[Repeat x 12]
Brain dead"
6	Exodus	"All my friends
Own a low rider
Low rider
Is a little higher

Low rider
Drives a little slower
Low rider
Is a little lower

Low rider
Don't use no gas now
Low rider
Don't drive too fast

Take a little trip and see
Take a little trip with me"
7	Exodus	"I never smoked with no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me something I never had
Pulled me down with you
Pulled me up, think I'm in love
Hope you can pull me through

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Oh woman you give to me
More than I can take
But listen honey, I don't mind
You're a habit I don't want to break
Don't want none of that hard stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in love, and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

Gee I was happy as a man could be
To far gone to escape
Power of love, don't pull me off
Just write on my grave:"
8	Exodus	"When I take your flesh and lacerate you
Exposing all your hate
There's nothing left but lies to throw away

Eviscerate you
Reduce you to your fate
Deleted and erased all your decay

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound

The bane of my existence cancerous
A tumor on my soul
Unnecessary wart upon my skin

Full of puss
You're a Judas and a troll
Lance the boil rooted deep within

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound

Rest assured when I pollute you
Your disease I will correct
My contagion
Only now I know the source

I uproot you
Lance the boil disinfect
Pestilence of ruin's run its course

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound"
9	Exodus	"I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it's the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket

Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing

Right off the back all these niggas be fronting
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Get that gut feeling you know that they coming
You ain't got no paper ain't even worth running
Hoped out the cutlass and hopped in the bucket
Run in your mouth you'll get popped in your nugget
You had the ball then you dropped it then f*ck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don't let yourself be the next kiss opponent
No I ain't driving but yeah bitch I own it
Usually niggas get caught in the moment
I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones half ones even zips moving
We ain't even gonna talk about the bricks moving
Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin
Hard times come you just gotta get through 'em
These lil niggas got a lotta shit brewing
Feds get involved then alotta shit ruined
Used to spit at niggas now I spit through 'em
I don't wash clothes nigga I just get new ones
Real boss niggas it be hard to get to 'em
Yeah real low on the suckers
I walked out the trap house and hopped in the Cutlass

I hopped in the Cutlass

Where I'm from ain't nothing but survival
Before niggas pray the gonna pick up that rifle
Before niggas sleep they gonna camp out and snipe you
Wipe you off the face of the earth your face on a shirt
Ive been through in that phantom fly back to the place that I'm from
But not happy with that they took my brother the government kidnap and shit
I ain't just talking I ain't just rapping said it really happened
That's why I get on shit that you with and I vomit
I don't give a f*ck you know how Exo coming
It's beef I'm at you and I might be atacha woman
I make it look like you put time in for nothing
Don't make no sudden movements around me I'm clutching
These niggas haven't seen the money I'm touching
I even put their hands on cars that I'm pushing
But I ain't jumping for a nigga

I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage

11	Exodus	"Darkness, your surest bet
Wage of sin and blood roulette
Laying the odds against your gods
High stakes and no regret
No parlay in this game of hell
Lose your soul, they sound the knell
Nothing ventured nothing gained
The cards foretell

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

Salvation, a game of chance
Roll of the dice, the devil's dance
Speculate and tempt your fate
Life paid in advance
Double down and pull one more
Even money you even the score
Can't renege you pay the vig
You're spoken for

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

Eternity on the money line
Cloven one pulls three of a kind
You bet the spread and end up dead
Too late to change your mind
You went all in, didn't hedge your bets
Dark bookmaker collects all debts
Death begets the devil's hand
The wheel resets

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride"
12	Exodus	"We're throwing down the gauntlet
Chomping at the bit about to lay down the law
Show you all the way
Bare witness to genesis
Of the violence the way it was back in the day.
We've been here from the start with a one track mind,
We kept the hate alive.
Always had the power, now is zero hour,
Tonight we're gonna fight like it's 1985.

Blood in, blood out,
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out,
This is a ****ing dynasty of trash notoriety.
Dive in or bow out,
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family.
All in or all out,
Half way, no way. Give it all you've got!
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed
Let's see what you brought.
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out.

Stand tall, show you've got no backbone.
Welcome all who never took more than gave
Punish all deceptions, no exceptions
Fortune always favors the brave
Bring your anger,
Bring the mayhem,
Anything you do is allowed.
You're the kings of pit insanity
Tonight we're gonna rage and make Paul Baloff proud.

We're bringing down the thunder
Bottling the light, battering the way
Burning down the place
Our one stance, zero tolerance
Time to cut to the chase
We expect nothing less than a full scale riot
Give everything that you've got
Put an end to the peace and quiet
Let's start the pit that time forgot.

14	Exodus	"Blitzkrieg, insurgence
Under the thumbs of the powers that be
Conflict, tension, unlawful detention
They don't give a f*ck about you or me
We are all just collateral damage
The shit they step in on their way
Just puppets used to their advantage
To chew up and throw away

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce, we
Decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we
Ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end, we are
Betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid

Illuminati of the one percent
We chase their carrot on a string
Wall street deceit all stuck on repeat
Peons serving to the kings
To them it's all just a natural selection
A birth right of gluttony
Like a kind of Immaculate Conception
Of inbred conformity

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce, we
Decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we
Ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end, we are
Betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid

Street punk makes a fatal mistake
Dared to look him in the eye
Ten rounds, just standing his ground
Only choice, he had to die
Just another violent confrontation
Murder in the first degree
Another ready, aim fire
Do more time for petty larceny

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce, we
Decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we

16	Exodus	"Awakened in ice near dead in a tub
Organs are cut out and gone, you pay the price
Phone and note call 911!!
Startled and scared
What to do next?
Who must be called?
Or will it be death!

Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest
For sale for all

The meat wagon greets you
And speeds to a thrust
Hurry to sew on the patch
Strapped to the table and cut to the bone
The blood type is just not a match
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death!

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest
For sale for all

Awake in a room dripping with blood
The hunted has turned to the hunt
Attention is turning from me onto you
You have the parts that I want
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death!

Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest

The time for killing is ripe

A family lies bathed in blood

Sadist and evangelist
Perfect plan of deviant bliss
Rapist and antagonist
Sunken deep in his bloody abyss
Haunting all and taunting men
Never knowing when he'll strike again
Psychotic hunter in orgasmic desire
Tighten the cord, watch the life expire
Wilt to be mine?
Thou shalt not scream nor yet free the line
Think of me and how it's going to be when
I prey

Hatred, my light upon my chosen path

Black angel walk with me forevermore
Begin my transformation

Divinity of death divine

Pulse rushes, I'm set free from my cage
I no longer walk alone
Make her animosity my own

Always laying the blame

Desensitized and ruthless
Compassion vacated
I'm so disassociated
I'm sick of what I've become
But this world has rendered me
So fucking numb

Dead body on the street
Won't give it a second glance
Famine, poverty, just victims of circumstance

Wage of sin and blood roulette
Laying the odds against your gods

No parlay in this game of hell
Lose your soul, they sound the knell
Nothing ventured nothing gained
The cards foretell

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

Salvation, a game of chance
Roll of the dice, the devil's dance
Speculate and tempt your fate
Life paid in advance
Double down and pull one more
Even money you even the score
Can't renege you pay the vig
You're spoken for

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

Eternity on the money line
Cloven one pulls three of a kind
You bet the spread and end up dead
Too late to change your mind
You went all in, didn't hedge your bets
Dark bookmaker collects all debts
Death begets the devil's hand
The wheel resets

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride"

Chomping at the bit about to lay down the law
Show you all the way
Bare witness to genesis
Of the violence the way it was back in the day.
We've been here from the start with a one track mind,
We kept the hate alive.
Always had the power, now is zero hour,
Tonight we're gonna fight like it's 1985.

Blood in, blood out,
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out,
This is a ****ing dynasty of trash notoriety.
Dive in or bow out,
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family.
All in or all out,
Half way, no way. Give it all you've got!
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed
Let's see what you brought.
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out.

Stand tall, show you've got no backbone.
Welcome all who never took more than gave
Punish all deceptions, no exceptions
Fortune always favors the brave
Bring your anger,
Bring the mayhem,
Anything you do is allowed.
You're the kings of pit insanity
Tonight we're gonna rage and make Paul Baloff proud.

Blood in, blood out,
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out,

Let's see what you brought.
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out.

We're bringing down the thunder
Bottling the light, battering the way
Burning down the place
Our one stance, zero tolerance
Time to cut to the chase
We expect nothing less than a full scale riot
Give everything that you've got
Put an end to the peace and quiet
Let's start the pit that time forgot.

Blood in, blood out,
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do

Under the thumbs of the powers that be
Conflict, tension, unlawful detention
They don't give a f*ck about you or me
We are all just collateral damage
The shit they step in on their way
Just puppets used to their advantage
To chew up and throw away

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce, we
Decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we
Ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end, we are
Betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid

Illuminati of the one percent
We chase their carrot on a string
Wall street deceit all stuck on repeat
Peons serving to the kings
To them it's all just a natural selection
A birth right of gluttony
Like a kind of Immaculate Conception
Of inbred conformity

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress

No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we

Betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid

Street punk makes a fatal mistake
Dared to look him in the eye
Ten rounds, just standing his ground
Only choice, he had to die
Just another violent confrontation
Murder in the first degree
Another ready, aim fire
Do more time for petty larceny

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce, we
Decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we

Betrayed, unafraid

26	Exodus	"When I take your flesh and lacerate you
Exposing all your hate
There's nothing left but lies to throw away

Eviscerate you
Reduce you to your fate
Deleted and erased all your decay

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound

The bane of my existence cancerous
A tumor on my soul
Unnecessary wart upon my skin

Full of puss
You're a Judas and a troll
Lance the boil rooted deep within

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound

Rest assured when I pollute you
Your disease I will correct
My contagion
Only now I know the source

I uproot you
Lance the boil disinfect
Pestilence of ruin's run its course

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound"

Organs are cut out and gone, you pay the price

Or will it be death!

Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest

The meat wagon greets you
And speeds to a thrust
Hurry to sew on the patch
Strapped to the table and cut to the bone
The blood type is just not a match
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death!

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest
For sale for all

Awake in a room dripping with blood
The hunted has turned to the hunt
Attention is turning from me onto you
You have the parts that I want
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death!

Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

Dragging their victims into lunacy
And putting it all on film
Wretched dregs of society
Killers of children
Rapists of women
Sado-sexual violence

Immoral killing with indifference
Aroused as your victims cry
Unjust pain they love to inflict
Breaking their souls, then their minds
Malevolent and rancid perversions
The outcome is always death
Bodies thrown down into a hole
Maggots consuming the flesh

Fear-A macabre madness
Fiendish carnage with rabid butchery
Pain-sadistically tortured
Rejoicing in their victims slavery
Rape-forced violations
Malicious desecration of the thrall
Slave-depraved exploitation

Sado-sexual violence
Sick-twisted rituals
Vile defiling of the enslaved
Lie-decimate aspirations abused
At the hands of the deranged
Kill-and slaughter the damned
With gruesome and heinous suffering
Death-merciless killing
With despicable and cruel agony
Sado-sexual violence

Excoriate the legal system
Exposing all of its flaws
One kills himself with cyanide
The other makes a mockery of the law
The act of killing eroticized
Dismissive to call you insane

Progeny of hate refined

Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why, still oh so vague

To inner demons I succumb

Exhibit A in man's atrocity

Take the gun, take the knife
Take the pain, then take the life
My taste for homicide
Is rising up and amplified
Bloody deeds, my only friend
With me til the bitter end
Together we are one

Could never be so wrong

You're wasting time
My routine
Is the scene of the crime
I make the Devil laugh
And Angels wail
Forever I will reside
Beyond the pale

Heartless bastard cold as ice
Victim of my own device
The strong prey on the weak
Dead men, they never speak
All part of man's condition
On this path to our perdition
We kill along the way

Antipathy, the lesson of the day
They never should have pushed me away

Student bodies lying dead in the halls
A blood splattered treatise of hate
Class dismissed is my hypothesis
Gun fire ends the debate
All I ever wanted was a little affection
But no one ever gave it to me
My hate primer's the result of my rejection
You'll die for it, and I'll die for thee

The halls of learning now a shooting range
My final exam with a gun
Killing everyone who ever thought me strange
My bloody dissertation has begun
Pomp and circumstance replaced by bullet wounds
The smell of gunpowder on the air
Murder is the nightmare of this afternoon
My malevolence, your cross to bear
All because of my despair

[Chorus]

Hate lives in me
Hate lives in me
Hate I need it and it needs me
Hate I feed it and it fed me
Hate I breed it and it bred me
Hate
Hate I read it and it read me
Hate I lead it and it led me
Hate I bleed it and it bled me
I breathe it in, and it breathes through me

While SWAT teams swarm all around the quad
The symposium of slaughter carries on
Smith and Wesson is my only God
And the line in the sand has been drawn
Valedictorian of violence
Graduation day, one bullet remains
Charles Whitman set the precedent
I pull the trigger and blow out my brains
They never knew I was insane

I instruct you
And I destruct you
I deconstruct you
Until my hate has fucked you"

Where angels fear to tread
Into the ruins of a civilization

Our destiny is soon revealed
Battle strewn, no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight
Downfall!
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand?
Bonfire of the vanities and spite

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sewn
When all the marble palaces
Are blackened, sacked and burned
Will we understand man's ignorance
Through all the lessons learned?

[Chorus]

Fall!
Fall!
Fall!
Downfall!

So quick to claim the credit due
Yet no one takes the blame
Like Nero played his violin
While watching Rome in flames
Implosion of our nations through
Decisions of its kings
Downfall of our creation
It's the end of everything

40	Exodus	"Do as they say, not as they do
March to the tune of the Christian right
Hypocrites, their rules they don't apply to you

Guilty as sin yet innocence presumed
Still they talk the talk

Christian soldiers
Trudging off to war
Behind the cross of Jesus
And still they

March!
March!
Everybody loves a parade

Masters of hyperbole
They claim to know what's wrong or right
The mob led to believe so easily
Like a moth to a light
Pro-life, anti-life and so sincere
Battalions of the dull of mind
Obeying all they read, see or hear
The ignorant leading the blind

Christian soldiers
Trudging off to war
Behind the cross of Jesus
And still they

[Chorus]

Brain dead plebeians
Rally 'round the Bible and the flag
Their prophets are a plumber
And a small minded rifle packing hag
One nation under God
And one under the thumb
Marching to the beat of a different kind of drum
It's the march of the sycophants!

Town hall rabble
Cry liberty and justice for the few
It's the end of they world as they know it
That's what they'll say to you
Conspiracy theories eaten raw like meat
Fed by the mother of lies
They suck straight from the teat
It's the march of the sycophants!"
41	Exodus	"Sadistic soldiers of the rising sun
1937's when the rape had begun
The ancient city fell under imperial rule
By an engine of war and lust, savage and cruel

Assembly line efficiency of killing machines
Unbridled fury of the sick and obscene
Systematic sexual degradation
The more perverse the greater exaltation

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
They turned the waters of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside and brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

Bestial and violent, six weeks of suffering
So black was the day they marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning

Tanks ran over men nailed to boards
Decapitations with an officer's sword
Gang rape of women, both the young and the old
Frozen to death in waters ice cold

Disembowelment, some are buried alive
Suicide's preferred for those who survive
The stench of corpses everywhere in the streets
Dogs feast on the rotting meat

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
They turned the waters of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside and brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

Bestial and violent, six weeks of suffering
So black was the day they marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
It was the rape of Nanking

Thousands forced into prostitution
So many years and still no restitution
The carnage of Carthage so easily outdone
Add all the blood you get 1200 tons

Massacre removed from history books
No mention of men hung from iron hooks
All counter to the rules of war
They made a city an army's whore

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
They turned the waters of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside and brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

Bestial and violent, six weeks of suffering
So black was the day, they marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
It was the rape of Nanking"
42	Exodus	"Land of enchantment and fake reality
Where they put in vitro breeding machines
On the cover of a magazine
Trailer trash and human freaks
They grab their minute of fame
And still the puppets watch
And everybody knows the names
That's why I say

Burn, Hollywood, burn
When it's dead and gone we'll never miss a thing
Burn, Hollywood, burn
No more rotten to the core little sweet sixteens
Burn. Hollywood, burn
Time's running out on their minute of fame
Let's douse the fire by pissing on the flames

So young, bitch and famous
Hotel heiress, glamor queen
The only reason we know your name
Is bad night vision pornography
From the ""real"" housewives of Botox hills
To the cunts of Bel-Aire
You can't look away from the cathode ray
Why does anybody fucking care

Burn, Hollywood, burn
When it's dead and gone we'll never miss a thing
Burn, Hollywood, burn
No more rotten to the core little sweet sixteens
Burn. Hollywood, burn
Time's running out on their minute of fame
Let's douse the fire by pissing on the flames"
43	Exodus	"Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds for the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth hell bent on their genocide
Complete destruction, blood lust seduction
Drinking warm blood with a smile
Beyond the horror, they're born to suffer
Hundreds of thousands defiled

Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned

Dissected while still alive, the violence you live to endure
Cleansing, inherently violent, purging the world for the pure
Triumph of evil, hatred primeval
Unenlightened corrupted souls
Orgy of murder, heartless and vile
Merchants of death in control

Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned, war is hell

Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds for the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth hell bent on their genocide

Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell"
44	Exodus	"Immortal subjugator, usurper, dominator
Blood ruler of the dark
Lord of the shadow world, flag of black unfurled
Foul, unholy patriarch
Enslaver of mankind, king of all unkind
Light ender in black domain
I fear only the dawn, at war with the rising sun
Eternal dusk ordained

I lurk beside you, never to abide you
I live inside you, always to divide you
I stand between you, certain to unclean you
The night is my savior
The sun is my destroyer

Despotic tyrants liar, judgment always dire
Unrepentant fear machine
Dream world paralyzer, re of man, none the wiser
Beneath the surface, site unseen
My only enemy, the day, behest color, shades of grey
Rejoice in the coming of the night
Nightmares come all too real, dest horror soon revealed
Rising with the dying of the light

I lurk beside you, never to abide you
I live inside you, always to divide you
I stand between you, certain to unclean you
The night is my savior
The sun is my destroyer

In my dominion, day meets its demise
Ultraviolet adversary, like an open wound to cauterize
The night's assailant is the coming of the morning sun
Illuminescent antagonist, smashed to oblivion
I am god here, in the bowels of the human mind
Creature of imagination, born of the impure and unrefined
I prey on your fear, take all you hold dear and then I use it against you
So unwise for you to close your eyes
That's when I come to dispense you

Malignant dream accuser
Pleasant thought reverser
Loathsome bringer of dread
Slumber now vitiated
Sweet dreams abominated
Terrors better left unsaid
Villainous machination
Sub conscious tribulation
Tremble at the coming of the twilight
Rising with the setting sun
Returning when the day's undone
Ensuring an end to all good nights

I lurk beside you, never to abide you
I live inside you, always to divide you
I stand between you, certain to unclean you
The night is my savior
The sun is my destroyer"
45	Exodus	"Cesspool in orbit, our end has begun
We live on the third lump of shit from the sun
Planet in peril, but why give a f*ck
Soon the earth will run out of luck
Wreck it all until the land is stripped
Rejoice in the coming apocalypse
Sing loud the world's last lullaby
But my replies

Good riddance, goodbye
So long to this fucking world, sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance, goodnight
Adios planet earth, now die

Parasitic infestation, never ending procreation
Our shit stained constellation headed for its cancellation
Eternity of desecration, another misread calculation
Give the earth one last ovation before it starts the final
Crash and burn

Get down to business, cut to the chase
It's time for mankind's fall from grace
The end's coming sooner than you'll ever know
So sit back, relax and enjoy the show
No time to cry, I won't shed a tear
This is, after all the event of the year
You testify, but my replies

Good riddance, goodbye
So long to this fucking world, sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance, goodnight
Adios planet earth, now die"
46	Exodus	"Born again harder
Than I was before
Bringing the hammer down
Is more than metaphor
I live by the steel
Die by the blade
What reason is there to be
If you're living life afraid?

[Chorus]
The hammer is my symbol
The banner that I wave
The motto of my creed
Carved upon my grave
I life for the here and now
I live for the knife
My coat of arms
Is the hammer and life

Fear and cowardice
Harbingers of demise
Strength and the will to fight
Will lead you to the prize
Glory to all of those
Who conquer to the end
Honor the hammer
On it you can depend

[Chorus]"
47	Exodus	"A crumbling empire
Where angels fear to tread
Into the ruins of a civilization
A society ripped to shreds
No semblance of order
Into the world which I abjure
Where the bloody blade is forged
Am I the cause of the cure?

[Chorus]
Our destiny is soon revealed
Battle strewn, no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight
Downfall!
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand?
Bonfire of the vanities and spite

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sewn
When all the marble palaces
Are blackened, sacked and burned
Will we understand man's ignorance
Through all the lessons learned?

[Chorus]

Fall!
Fall!
Fall!
Downfall!

So quick to claim the credit due
Yet no one takes the blame
Like Nero played his violin
While watching Rome in flames
Implosion of our nations through
Decisions of its kings
Downfall of our creation
It's the end of everything

[Chorus]"
48	Exodus	"Man creates the god
And the god destroys the man
Betrayed by their own invention
The shepherd butches the lamb
A lion at the head of an army
Of sheep when comes time to feed
Like Saturn devoured his children
They’re consumed by belief

[Chorus]
I am the chosen one
And I hold the key
Behold the prodigal son
This good I do lives long after me
Let iconoclasm set you free

Christ is the same yesterday
And today, forever a lie
They concocted the heavens
To keep all the puppets in line
Narcotic, addictive desire
To believe they won’t go to hell
A dog that has bitten its master
That it once knew so well

[Chorus]

Figment of imagination
Oracle of ignorance
Corrupter of society
Killer of reason and innocence
An object of man’s creation
Made to fill the hole inside
But that abyss has only been opened wide

Wolves they guard the flock
And they slaughter the sick and the weak
Sorrow is all that they find
When salvation is all that they seek
The truth is the greatest lord
Where no fool commands the wise
Religion ten times undone
No room for compromise

[Chorus]"
49	Exodus	"Let not the sun go down on my wrath
I let it shake the world
Vengeance is the grudge I bear
Flag of reckoning unfurled
You are the architect
Of your own demise
So smile no more
I am the gatekeeper,
And you are mine for evermore

[Chorus]
Come greet the reaper
You know the time is nigh
This is the day of reckoning,
Your time to die
Brave men they spin in fear
At the sound of my voice
Say goodbye to life so dear
You no longer have a choice

Burnt black and silent,
Rust and blood
Upon my reaper's blade
I come collect the tolls
Gather up all the debts unpaid
I call when you least expect
But when you deserve it the most
Behold the timekeeper
The end is getting close

[Chorus]

The dead no longer have
A cross to bear
The dead no longer have
Need to despair
Death has come
And set the snare
Death will come
When you are unaware

The misbegotten have the gall
To think them safe and sound
They try to cheat the reaper
Scatter, hide, no matter, found
The wheel of life is standing still
For them it turns no more
Now comes the soul keeper
And you become my whore

[Chorus]"
50	Exodus	"Brainwashed into madness,
Your children are killers without fear
Manipulate and dominate,
Stealing their lives for your hate
Twisted perverted minds,
Think as we do or you die
Demagogue, fanatical tyrant
A false prophet seething with lies

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Propagation of violence
Your one god a disease upon man
Execution, crucifixion
The answer for those not in your plan
The penalty for contempt against your god
Is death and nothing else
Ignorant infidels
Are subhuman and will all burn in hell

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Smite the perverts and the obstinate
Praising the death of the free
United States of Islam
That's what you would like it to be
Violate the unbelievers
Praising crimes against man
Human rights mean nothing
Doctrine of death a scourge upon man

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god"
51	Exodus	"Life spent with lips on glass
Another hit, just one more blast
How long can you make it last?
Hit the pipe and vaporize
Feel the rush, so energized
Your longs being to crystallize
Try to stem the tide
From another five day ride
Don't you know your dead inside?
The world spins out of control
All amped up, nowhere to go
A glass house is all you know

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Spun and sleep deprived
The calendar burns before your eyes
Another hit, for now revived
So many sleepless nights
Only whet your appetite
Strike a match, the torch ignites
See the shards start cracking back
Watch them turn your world to black
While waiting for the heart attack
All your dreams are dead and gone
I tell you now, it won't be long
Before death ends this marathon

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Withered and sucked up
You're wasting away
Eyes sunken deep in your skull
You care not about yourself
Nor any other
Only if the pipe is full
Lick your lips
As you hover around the glass
Anxiously awaiting your turn
Depressed and paranoid
It's all gone to hell
Inhale as your world burns

Lost everything you own
Now waiting by the telephone
For the dope man to come home
All your friends and family
Are sickened by your need for speed
Only driven to exceed
So many years, so little time
For you to halt your life's decline
You've got to read the signs
Everything has come unwound
You've got to turn this shit around
Before you're six feet underground

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!"
52	Exodus	"It is no mystery
What you get is what you see

You've gone and done me wrong

You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out, right you off, there's never enough
Ways to throw you away

[Chorus]
You'd better start runnin'
'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist

You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out, write you off, when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris

[Chorus]

For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man

It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

So inhuman you don't speak its name
Its artillery sets the world aflame
Mechanical demon rolling 'cross the sand
Blood stained thing scorching black the holy land
Skin made of iron, heart made of steel
Lubricated by the blood beneath its wheels
Reclaiming the world for its king

Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

When I walk the streets
Got Loki on my side
Slit your throat, drink your blood
Who cares when others die

The more it hurts the better I feel
The world will fall insane
It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

[Chorus]
Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

[Chorus]

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine
I tell you all it's the way to live
Get stronger on death glory
Infringing on sacrificial rites
Death's your final story

[Chorus]"
66	Exodus	"Come into my home
Black master rules the night
See the power start to surge
Upon a hellish sight
It's time to raise them up
Up from below the grave
White bones glow savagery
Provide the light we crave

[Chorus]
Turn to look at Baphomet
From below and not above
Welcome to my sacrifice
Tonight there'll be no love

The darkness is my lover
She makes he feel strong
Take what I want, when I want
At night I do no wrong
When I walk the streets
Got Loki on my side
Slit your throat, drink your blood
Who cares when others die

[Chorus]

You thought you'd live for oh 50 long
Now it's your turn to die
Live with Satan down in Hell
Born to forever cry
Took your life I don't feel bad
Born to live in hell
Died for nothing, slow decay
Your body starts to smell"
67	Exodus	"Let's start a fire, biggest one you've ever seen
You bring the matches, I'll bring the gasoline
Ignite it, delight it, the flames grow higher
Burn the world upon a funeral pyre

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

Destroy it all, show no inhibition
Revel and rejoice in unbridled demolition
Smash it, f*ck it, nothing will remain
Detect it and wreck it but never take the blame

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

We have ignition!

Shake the earth from its very foundation
Lay waste to the world without hesitation
Break it, take it, you don't have any reason
F*ck it, destruct it, it's demolition season"
68	Exodus	"Rise up and revolt
Overthrow the government
Level all the temples
Destroy the monuments

Return to anarchy
Defy the Christian law
Prepare for mutiny
Prepare for coup d'etat

So begins our final riot act
Now that your in, there'll be no turning back
Smash everything, wreck it all with pride
The power of our revolution won't ever be denied

Reduce the halls of power
To ruin and to ash
An end to Christianity
An end to holy mass

The dawn of an iron age
Return to Pagan law
Lex Talionis
We rule by fang and claw

So begins our final riot act
Now that your in, there'll be no turning back
Smash everything, wreck it all with pride
The power of our revolution won't ever be denied"
69	Exodus	"Rise up and revolt
Overthrow the government

70	Exodus	"Let not the sun go down on my wrath
I let it shake the world
Vengeance is the grudge I bear
Flag of reckoning unfurled
You are the architect
Of your own demise
So smile no more
I am the gatekeeper,
And you are mine for evermore

[Chorus]
Come greet the reaper
You know the time is nigh
This is the day of reckoning,
Your time to die
Brave men they spin in fear
At the sound of my voice
Say goodbye to life so dear
You no longer have a choice

Burnt black and silent,
Rust and blood
Upon my reaper's blade
I come collect the tolls
Gather up all the debts unpaid
I call when you least expect
But when you deserve it the most
Behold the timekeeper
The end is getting close

[Chorus]

The dead no longer have
A cross to bear
The dead no longer have
Need to despair
Death has come
And set the snare
Death will come
When you are unaware

The misbegotten have the gall
To think them safe and sound
They try to cheat the reaper
Scatter, hide, no matter, found
The wheel of life is standing still
For them it turns no more
Now comes the soul keeper
And you become my whore

[Chorus]"
71	Exodus	"Brainwashed into madness,
Your children are killers without fear
Manipulate and dominate,
Stealing their lives for your hate
Twisted perverted minds,
Think as we do or you die
Demagogue, fanatical tyrant
A false prophet seething with lies

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Propagation of violence
Your one god a disease upon man
Execution, crucifixion
The answer for those not in your plan
The penalty for contempt against your god
Is death and nothing else
Ignorant infidels
Are subhuman and will all burn in hell

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Smite the perverts and the obstinate
Praising the death of the free
United States of Islam
That's what you would like it to be
Violate the unbelievers
Praising crimes against man
Human rights mean nothing
Doctrine of death a scourge upon man

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god"
72	Exodus	"We didn’t pay attention
To lessons learned in the past
Soon the sands in the desert
Will melt from the atomic blast
Mesopotamia’s ground zero
For the coming of world war
Thousands die in the sand
And I still don’t understand what for

[Chorus]
As it was, as it soon shall be
We’re teetering on the brink
Of a world war III
A repetition of history
As you soon shall see
As it was, as it soon shall be

War mongering leader of ours
Waves the flag of democracy
Sending our men out to die
In the name of bureaucracy
The oil fields of Iraq
Are overflowing with blood
Another man dies but the lies
Rain down like a flood

[Chorus]

No weapons of mass destruction
No threat to me
Just one man’s agenda for war,
Not a land of the free
I never gave a shit
About the Middle East
But now we lie in the bed that we’ve
Made, start the atomic feast

[Chorus]"
73	Exodus	"The glorious frailty of the human mind
Leads us to deceive the mother of mankind
Nature is our master, we serve her through our deeds
She teaches us that only death is guaranteed
If there was a hell, there must I ever be
Eternal life in heaven is but a fallacy
So if death is nothing, but a path to be trod
Walk with me and let me introduce you to your God

Come see an exhibition of atrocity
An ocean of eternity
One in which the shore you’ll never see
Or your God of make believe

You speak to the sky and no one answers back
And yet you wager the word of God is fact
The horrors we imagine in vivid clarity
Become a spectacle, your God’s atrocities
A mirror image, reflection of your soul
Just nature’s play, all her children have a role
God’s an actor, the world nature’s stage
Our fates are scripted like so many
Letters on a page

A composition of atrocity
The Story of Christianity
A fairy tale of tyranny
Recipe for catastrophe

Man’s inclination
Is to bend those who oppose to our will
Does your great creator think
The good are better made by ills?
Dream after dream, time after time
He who conquers endures
The grand design of the mother
We the disease, and her the cure

Unsatisfied longing for the slaughter
The master often slays her sons and her daughters
Death is but and undress of skin and of bone
When you return to her, no sins to atone
The ending is the same for the vile and devout
Let all the poisons that lurk in the mind
Hatch out
She has predetermined our end
Nothing more she will portend"
74	Exodus	"Man creates the god
And the god destroys the man
Betrayed by their own invention
The shepherd butches the lamb
A lion at the head of an army
Of sheep when comes time to feed
Like Saturn devoured his children
They’re consumed by belief

[Chorus]
I am the chosen one
And I hold the key
Behold the prodigal son
This good I do lives long after me
Let iconoclasm set you free

Christ is the same yesterday
And today, forever a lie
They concocted the heavens
To keep all the puppets in line
Narcotic, addictive desire
To believe they won’t go to hell
A dog that has bitten its master
That it once knew so well

[Chorus]

Figment of imagination
Oracle of ignorance
Corrupter of society
Killer of reason and innocence
An object of man’s creation
Made to fill the hole inside
But that abyss has only been opened wide

Wolves they guard the flock
And they slaughter the sick and the weak
Sorrow is all that they find
When salvation is all that they seek
The truth is the greatest lord
Where no fool commands the wise
Religion ten times undone
No room for compromise

[Chorus]"
75	Exodus	"Viscerated bodies
Planted deep beneath the earth
They fertilize the soil
And feed for all they’re worth
Within the garden
Of unearthly delights
True meaning of horror’s found
And hell’s within our sights

[Chorus]
He plants the seeds
The germinate
Black misdeeds, they pollinate
Within the garden of bleeding’s
Where the devil waits
To introduce you to your fate

Endless orchards dot the land
Of corpses up on spikes
Beauty’s in the eye of the
Beheaded on a pike
Bathed in lakes of fire
Until a cinder’s what remains
The stench of death it makes
The flowers bloom in his domain

[Chorus]

Bodies hang from branches
Like grapes hang from the vine
Garlands made of human flesh
They decorate his shrine
On the wind and through the trees,
The cries of suffering
For this is the garden
Of the king of the unclean"
76	Exodus	"Turn on the havoc
Let confusion reign
Random acts of violence
Shall not be done in vain
A din of destruction
An overture of rage
Countdown to bedlam
Let the mayhem
Accelerate
Soon we all
Will celebrate

Feel the primal urge
Adrenaline surge
Join the altercation
To the third degree
At full capacity
With no discrimination
Total oblivion
No phenomenon
Just par for the course
To the starting line
Your time to shine
On my mark we

[Chorus]
Quarrel!
We subjugate
We bring calamity
Everybody cooperate
Let’s start the bedlam
One, two, three

Anticipating the
Coming of the brawl
Collide like cannon fire
But only on my call
I provoke the melee
And I fan the flame
Coerce the herd into a
Stampede
They salivate
Turmoil
We aggravate

Feel the primal urge
Adrenaline surge
Join the altercation
To the third degree
At full capacity
With no discrimination
Total oblivion
No phenomenon
Just par for the course
To the starting line
Your time to shine
On my mark we

On my command
Everybody run amuck
Slam into everyone
Never stop to give a f*ck
This is the pinnacle
Of tumult,
It’s what you’ve waited for so
Let the vortex
Stimulate
On this day
We commemorate

Feel the primal urge
Adrenaline surge
Join the altercation
To the third degree
At full capacity
With no discrimination
Total oblivion
No phenomenon
Just par for the course
To the starting line
Your time to shine
On my mark we

77	Exodus	"Oh say can you fucking see
The missiles fall like rain
Bloody mountains majesty
Dead bodies on the plain
By the bombing's eerie light
See the crimsons waves of red
What so proudly they all fell
The twilight of the dead

[Chorus]
America the violent
The indifferent
God shit is grace on me
America the arrogant
The belligerent
Will live in infamy
We the people, for no people
Secure the blessings of tragedy
Do or don't we have established
The scar spangled banner

We pledge allegiance to no god
Only to the blood
Liberty is just a dream
When dying in the mud
This, the land of the deceived, home of the depraved
Bombs, they drop like falling leaves
And the deadly flag still waves

[Chorus]

Red the beautiful color of blood
Flowing like a stream
White the color of bleaching bone
Lovely and obscene
Blue the bruising color of flesh
Battered, ripped and torn
The colors of the flag of hate
Of violence and porn
What you see is what you get
You haven't see the bloody trail yet
I'm no patriot, just a hate-triot

Blood sport, my sure bet
See the flag, get a body bag
Salvation form a .44 mag.
Nothing left, no one saved
'Cause our goddamn motherfucking bloody ass
Banner still waves"
78	Exodus	"It is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out, right you off, there's never enough
Ways to throw you away

[Chorus]
You'd better start runnin'
'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist

You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out, write you off, when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris

[Chorus]

For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man

[Chorus]"
79	Exodus	"Christ on a cross
Such a symbol of loss
Since what seems like the dawn of time
It's just an engine of grief
Yeah, a bloody belief
One that has no reason or rhyme
You're cruci-fucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock

[Chorus]
I believe in nothing
Least of all in the word of shit
So hide in your shroud of urine
Because I can't take the smell of it

God isn't great
Just an icon of hate
Intolerance and despise
Believe in me
And I will set you free
I never heard a bigger pack of lies
It's ludicrous
That anyone of us
Would want to be lead by the blind
It's all in vain
It'll be your bane
If you're looking for the divine

[Chorus]

Forgive and forget
Such an empty threat
Religion at the end of the blade
The insanity
Of Christianity
Is just a fucking masquerade
You're cruci-fucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock

[Chorus]"
80	Exodus	"In life you're moving forward
But sometime for the worse
Always keep a step ahead
Never in reverse
The cards are stacked against you
In everything you do
But you try to get out alive
When you don't have a clue
You always feel the tension
Breathing at your back
To be the best that you can be
To be on the attack
Kicking down the wall
And kicking your face in
Means I'm moving forward
My new life can begin

Forward march in your face
Taking back, taking place
Before you die, living fast
Take a chance, hauling ass

Never, no never, no never
Move in reverse

Here I am; I'm moving straight
Fuckin' forward, and I'm taking all
The steps to blow on right past you
I'm never gonna back down to you
And all your people 
Who think that you're the best
No one can beat you
Well, I've got some news for you, you motherfucker
There's a new man in town who isn't any sucker
So if you don't back down
I'll put my bat to an
Angry motherfucker such as yourself

Now I'm going to wipe out
All those who say they're first
I'll be the first in line
My attitude's the worst
Because I am so spoiled
And never second best
I will leave you in the dust
And lay your ass to rest
So never underestimate
The mind of evil thoughts
I will bring you down
Spit you out before I'm caught
Because I have the power
And the upper hand
Everybody in the way
Will know that I'm the man

Forward march in your face
Taking back, taking place
Before you die, living fast
Take a chance, hauling ass

Never, no never, no never
Move in reverse"
81	Exodus	"They're everywhere and everyplace
Scum of the human race
Stickin' to my skin just like a rash
Society's their scapegoat
But I am the antidote
And it's time to take out the trash
The world's a big cesspit
Of puke and piss and dogshit
But I ain't gonna be its whore
Follow and I'll lead the way
Predators are now the prey
Results like these are hard to ignore

You may think I'm insane
Or maybe just a little absurd
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

I know I'm not the only one
Who thinks that something must be done
To clean the garbage up off the street
Dare to look me in the eye
I bring the truth, never lie
To me, they're just another piece of meat
The punishment will be swift and sure
For this disease, I am the cure
No problem, the doctor is in
My prescription for a better life's
A riffle or a razor knife
Remove whoever's under your skin

But please, don't call it a murder
Cause murder's such a dirty word
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

When will everyone realize
Some people should be sterilized
Their tubes are only fit to be tied
All they do is shit and breed
To ignorant to ever succeed
Stupidity should not be multiplied
Lend them not a helping hand
Or the future will be damned
The world will take a turn for the worse
The human race should be purified
Or we'll all be mongrelized
Implement the cure for the curse

You may think I'm a madman
Or maybe just a little disturbed
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling
I'm just culling
I'm just culling
I'm just culling the herd"
82	Exodus	"The honeymoons over and the loves gone sour
Her nagging has got you down
But you picked the wrong way to deal with it
You chose to slap her around
When you exchanged your wedding vows
Nobody said ""you may now fist the bride""
Now that the little woman went and got her gun
The love ain't all that died

[Chorus]
Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Began for her when the bullet's hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fist

When she took your hand in marriage
It didn't mean right across the face
Small woman, big man, it takes a lot of guts
You're just a pussy in the first place
But now that your wedding chamber's
The one the bullet's in
Brave man, look at you, not so tough
When the hammer's cockin'

[Chorus]

The little woman had all the shit that she could take
Her intuition said ""lock and load""
He-man, what's your plan to get out of this
She's gonna fill your ass with bullet holes
Guess who's bigger when she's squeezing the trigger
I got news, it isn't you
When they carry your body out over the threshold
You'll wish you never said ""I do""

[Chorus]"
83	Exodus	"Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you

I get off on negativity
Makes me laugh to see your strife
I won't succumb to your numb
I owe nothing to no one
Are you sick of me
I don't care
Never be a kiss ass
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you

Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you

Throwing down"
84	Exodus	"You put your faith in Christianity
I put mine in artillery
My M-16, my lord and savior
Christ never done me a motherfucking favor

Pay for all of those in pain
For those who died in vain
Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War
War
War
War is my shepherd

Hate it if we can't comprehend it
Kill it if we don't understand it
Pray to god and your fate is sealed
As you die alone in the killing fields

Farwell, Graham and Farahkahn
They need god, I need napalm
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition
My sermon is my demolition

War
War is
War is my
War is my shepherd"
85	Exodus	"When you feel the darkness calling out your name
Don't try to fight the power surge
Don't you laugh, for this is not a game
Your powerless, don't resist the urge
So many black hearts answering the call
Legions of the musically possessed
Congregations joining in our free-for-all
Unleashing all the rage they've repressed

[Chorus]
Come to us
Succumb to lust
Giving in to our ministry of sin
You know the drill
Do as you will
Dance like the demons of the din
All will yearn
For our nocturne
The dawning of our cult is at hand
Come and pray
We know the way
Bow to the tempo of the damned

We are all leaders of the horde
Keepers of the apes of wrath
Heed the call of the volume lord
High priest of the bloodbath
Serve unto us, surrender us your souls
And great rewards you'll receive
And when the tempo has taken the control
Even the heretic's will believe

[Chorus]"
86	Exodus	"Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated

Now they death day come

Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after

No words for man's lament

My will be done

Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear

The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered

Burn the world upon a funeral pyre

Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

Destroy it all, show no inhibition
Revel and rejoice in unbridled demolition
Smash it, f*ck it, nothing will remain
Detect it and wreck it but never take the blame

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

We have ignition!

Shake the earth from its very foundation
Lay waste to the world without hesitation
Break it, take it, you don't have any reason
F*ck it, destruct it, it's demolition season"

Another hit, just one more blast
How long can you make it last?
Hit the pipe and vaporize
Feel the rush, so energized
Your longs being to crystallize
Try to stem the tide
From another five day ride
Don't you know your dead inside?
The world spins out of control
All amped up, nowhere to go
A glass house is all you know

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Spun and sleep deprived
The calendar burns before your eyes
Another hit, for now revived
So many sleepless nights
Only whet your appetite
Strike a match, the torch ignites
See the shards start cracking back
Watch them turn your world to black
While waiting for the heart attack
All your dreams are dead and gone
I tell you now, it won't be long
Before death ends this marathon

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Withered and sucked up
You're wasting away
Eyes sunken deep in your skull
You care not about yourself
Nor any other
Only if the pipe is full
Lick your lips
As you hover around the glass
Anxiously awaiting your turn
Depressed and paranoid
It's all gone to hell
Inhale as your world burns

Lost everything you own
Now waiting by the telephone
For the dope man to come home
All your friends and family
Are sickened by your need for speed
Only driven to exceed
So many years, so little time
For you to halt your life's decline
You've got to read the signs
Everything has come unwound
You've got to turn this shit around
Before you're six feet underground

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!"
91	Exodus	"Unrelenting vengeance
On man for all his sins
Ruthless eradication
Duty of reckoning to begin
The human race is a cancer
Fueled by power and lust
Punishment is the answer
And payment is your blood

Death and destruction
Hellish cries are the sound
Headlong into hell
Retribution is now
Inflict the suffering
Let the punishment fit the crime
I belong to vengeance
And vengeance is mine

Choking out the life
Of every living thing
History repeats itself
World brought down by greed
Prostitute the truth
Stealing from the blind
Arrogant indifference
The raping of mankind

You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew

I can't take any more excuses
No longer needed and you don't have nay uses
Washed up, washed out, what more can I say

You are me, I am abomination

I am the overdose

All you've known to hate

95	Exodus	"A straight razor and a flick of the wrist
Brass knuckles and a willing fist

Violence is bliss

What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone

Two things that I can't ignore
Dark nights and an unlocked door
I get the feeling and I follow through
I get high like I'm sniffing glue
It's time to let the games commence
This really helps my self-confidence
Blood orgy for the hedonist
Violence is bliss

I'm going, going, going, going, gone

I never leave any telltale traces
Only fear frozen on dead faces
An orgasm of depravity
It's the best kind of therapy
I always flee the scene of the crime
No victims, left to drop the dime
So many lives yet to be dismissed
Violence is bliss"
96	Exodus	"Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Man's bloody inclination
God's final abdication
Angels weep on bended knee
So beings the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man

My will be done
Now they death day come

Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the malediction
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for man's lament

My will be done
Now they death day come

On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
And the one you so revere

The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to apologize
Can you feel the irony?
War for all eternity

My will be done
Now they death day come"
97	Exodus	"Can't withhold my anger won't control my rage
My bloodlust will be sated
I'm locked and loaded and ready to engage
Killing everything I've always hated

A motherfucking Van Gogh with a gun
About to paint his masterpiece
Blow the world into oblivion
Paint with the blood of the deceased

Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony

Written in human debris
Art and murder true synonymy
No appeal, no ""I got a raw deal"", I don't give a f*ck
One thing is clear, I've got a deaf ear

[Pre-Chorus]
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop till the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide

The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
My .44
Magnum
My .44 magnum opus

Bodies are the canvas, ammo is the vision
For my greatest work of art
I'm waging my own inquisition
Tearing everything apart

I'm building a monument to horror
A temple so divine
Remembrance to those I've massacred
Death the grand design

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

People will stare in disbelief and awe
When they see what I've created
Still life, no life beautiful and raw
The world will be captivated

Like nothing done before
A work so terrible and vicious
A masterpiece of gore

99	Exodus	"Tank treads crushing over piles of broken bones
Siege engine revving and coming to atone
Poisonous black smoke billows from its eyes
Unholy war machine can't be compromised
Fueled by the corpses feted fleshed
Never turning back forward to the death
Its only mission is killing everything
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

So inhuman you don't speak its name
Its artillery sets the world aflame
Mechanical demon rolling 'cross the sand
Blood stained thing scorching black the holy land
Skin made of iron, heart made of steel
Lubricated by the blood beneath its wheels
Reclaiming the world for its king
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice

You bring the matches, I'll bring the gasoline
Ignite it, delight it, the flames grow higher
Burn the world upon a funeral pyre

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

Destroy it all, show no inhibition
Revel and rejoice in unbridled demolition
Smash it, f*ck it, nothing will remain
Detect it and wreck it but never take the blame

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

We have ignition!

Lay waste to the world without hesitation
Break it, take it, you don't have any reason
F*ck it, destruct it, it's demolition season"

116	Exodus	"A straight razor and a flick of the wrist
Brass knuckles and a willing fist
A big knife and a little scream
They do wonders for my self-esteem
Warm blood and a cold embrace
The catch is better than the chase
They all ask why I'm doing this
Violence is bliss

What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone

Two things that I can't ignore
Dark nights and an unlocked door
I get the feeling and I follow through
I get high like I'm sniffing glue
It's time to let the games commence
This really helps my self-confidence
Blood orgy for the hedonist
Violence is bliss

What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone

I never leave any telltale traces
Only fear frozen on dead faces
An orgasm of depravity
It's the best kind of therapy
I always flee the scene of the crime
No victims, left to drop the dime
So many lives yet to be dismissed
Violence is bliss"
117	Exodus	"Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Man's bloody inclination
God's final abdication
Angels weep on bended knee
So beings the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man

My will be done
Now they death day come

Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the malediction
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for man's lament

My will be done
Now they death day come

On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
And the one you so revere

The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to apologize
Can you feel the irony?
War for all eternity

My will be done
Now they death day come"
118	Exodus	"Can't withhold my anger won't control my rage
My bloodlust will be sated
I'm locked and loaded and ready to engage
Killing everything I've always hated

A motherfucking Van Gogh with a gun
About to paint his masterpiece
Blow the world into oblivion
Paint with the blood of the deceased

Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony

Written in human debris
Art and murder true synonymy
No appeal, no ""I got a raw deal"", I don't give a f*ck
One thing is clear, I've got a deaf ear

[Pre-Chorus]
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop till the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide

[Chorus]
The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
My .44
Magnum
My .44 magnum opus

Bodies are the canvas, ammo is the vision
For my greatest work of art
I'm waging my own inquisition
Tearing everything apart

I'm building a monument to horror
A temple so divine
Remembrance to those I've massacred
Death the grand design

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

People will stare in disbelief and awe
When they see what I've created
Still life, no life beautiful and raw
The world will be captivated

Never have they seen something so ambitious
Like nothing done before
A work so terrible and vicious
A masterpiece of gore

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]"
119	Exodus	"Tank treads crushing over piles of broken bones
Siege engine revving and coming to atone
Poisonous black smoke billows from its eyes
Unholy war machine can't be compromised
Fueled by the corpses feted fleshed
Never turning back forward to the death
Its only mission is killing everything
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

So inhuman you don't speak its name
Its artillery sets the world aflame
Mechanical demon rolling 'cross the sand
Blood stained thing scorching black the holy land
Skin made of iron, heart made of steel
Lubricated by the blood beneath its wheels
Reclaiming the world for its king
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine!"
120	Exodus	"You put your faith in Christianity
I put mine in artillery

For those who died in vain
Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War

Kill it if we don't understand it

When dying in the mud
This, the land of the deceived, home of the depraved
Bombs, they drop like falling leaves
And the deadly flag still waves

[Chorus]

Red the beautiful color of blood
Flowing like a stream
White the color of bleaching bone
Lovely and obscene
Blue the bruising color of flesh
Battered, ripped and torn
The colors of the flag of hate
Of violence and porn
What you see is what you get
You haven't see the bloody trail yet
I'm no patriot, just a hate-triot

Blood sport, my sure bet
See the flag, get a body bag

Bombs, they drop like falling leaves

White the color of bleaching bone
Lovely and obscene
Blue the bruising color of flesh
Battered, ripped and torn
The colors of the flag of hate
Of violence and porn
What you see is what you get
You haven't see the bloody trail yet
I'm no patriot, just a hate-triot

Blood sport, my sure bet
See the flag, get a body bag
Salvation form a .44 mag.
Nothing left, no one saved
'Cause our goddamn motherfucking bloody ass
Banner still waves"

Stringimi che ormai io sono il mare
Questo brivido ti sciogliera'

Parlami, abbracciami, scivola, azzurra luna
Foglie e il viento ci porta, siamo ali verso il blu
Stringimi e lasciate andare, il mio viento ora sei tu

Legami con I capelli il cuore
Tu mia onda scendi dentro me
Stringimi che ormai noi siamo il mare
Questo brivido ti sciolgera'

E le notti fuggono, Scivolo baciandoti
Mille lune, mille onde, che attraversano il nostro mare
Legami con I capelli il cuore questo brivido ti sciogliera'

There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?"
160	Exodus	"Sharing with us what he knows
Shining eyes are big and blue
And all around him water flows
This world to him is new
This world to him is new
To touch a face
To kiss a smile
New eyes see no race
The essence of a child
The essence
He's born to shimmer, he's born to shine
He's born to radiate
He's born to live, he's born to love
But we'll teach him not to hate
True love it is a rock
Smoothed over by a stream
No ticking of a clock
Truly measures what that means
Truly measures what that means
And this thing they call our time
Heard a brilliant woman say
She said you know it's crazy
How I want to try to capture mine
I think I love this woman's way
I think I love this woman's way she shimmers, the way she shines
The way she radiates
The way she lives, the way she loves
The way she never hates
Sometimes I think of all of this that can surround me
I know it all as being mine
But she kisses me and wraps herself around me
She gives me love, she gives me time
And I feel fine I feel fine
But time I cannot change
So here's to looking back
You know I drink a whole bottle of my pride
And I toast to change to keep these demons off my back
Just get these demons off my back
'Cause I want to shimmer, I want to shine
I want to radiate
I want to live, I want to love
I want to try to learn not to hate
Try not to hate
We're born to shimmer, we're born to shine
We're born to radiate
We're born to live, we're born to love
We're born to never hate"

I love the sound of pain
The more it hurts the better I feel
The world will fall insane
It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

[Chorus]
Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

[Chorus]

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine
I tell you all it's the way to live
Get stronger on death glory
Infringing on sacrificial rites
Death's your final story

[Chorus]"
163	Exodus	"Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you
Die!

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

[Repeat x 12]
Brain dead"
164	Exodus	"Come into my home
Black master rules the night
See the power start to surge
Upon a hellish sight
It's time to raise them up
Up from below the grave
White bones glow savagery
Provide the light we crave

[Chorus]
Turn to look at Baphomet
From below and not above
Welcome to my sacrifice
Tonight there'll be no love

The darkness is my lover
She makes he feel strong
Take what I want, when I want
At night I do no wrong
When I walk the streets
Got Loki on my side
Slit your throat, drink your blood
Who cares when others die

[Chorus]

You thought you'd live for oh 50 long
Now it's your turn to die
Live with Satan down in Hell
Born to forever cry
Took your life I don't feel bad
Born to live in hell
Died for nothing, slow decay
Your body starts to smell"
165	Exodus	"I'm feeling so tired can't understand it
Just had a fortnight sleep
I'm feeling so tired, oh, so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
Feeling hungry can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating faster than a big bass drum

Yeah you got to mix it child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch
You got to mix it child
You got to fix it must be love
It's a bitch

Sometimes I'm sexy, move like a stud
Kicking the stalls all night
Sometimes I'm so shy, got to be worked on
Don't have no bark or no bite"
166	Exodus	"Got out of bed about 3 PM thought it was a holiday
Then my boss called just to tell me
I'm late and he's giving my job away
Well I took me a walk to the liquor store
So I could drink away my blues
Spent my last ten bucks, then I dropped the bottle
And I broke it all over my shoes
So I got home to find the power's shut off,
There was someone knocking at my door
It was my landlord serving an eviction notice
'Cause my checks are bouncing off the floor
I pounded my head up against the wall
Thinking what else could go wrong
But this was only the beginning to a real bad day,
It wasn't gonna be a lot of fun

I knew I should have never gotten out of bed
'Cause of the rain cloud above my head
I'm down on my luck and it's plain to see
So tell me why does this happen to me?

When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours on me
When it rains it pours, and there's a storm moving in on me
When it rains it pours, raining down on only me
When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours

I drove across town to go see a friend
When I heard a siren on my tail
It turned out I had a warrant for my arrest
And I couldn't even post the bail
So I'm sittin' in a cell for 48 hours
Keepin' company with thieves and drunks
I'm free to go but my car's impounded
And I'm thinkin' 'bout becoming a monk
So I'm wandering around in a catatonic daze
Now barely a shell of a man
I look like I live out of a shopping cart
And I'm picking up aluminum cans
I staggered my way to an overpass
And fell to the dirt asleep
I figured out tomorrow is a new day
And maybe I could buy myself a life real cheap"
167	Exodus	"I've been on tender-hooks ending in dirty looks
Listening to the muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that
She says that's that, I don't want to chitter chat
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat
Pump it up when you don't really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it

Down in the pleasure center, hell bent or heaven sent
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing under hand that she wouldn't understand
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
You want to torture her, you want to talk to her
All the things you bought for her,
could not get her temperature
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission, hit and run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it"
168	Exodus	"I'm feeling so tired can't understand it
Just had a fortnight sleep
I'm feeling so tired, oh, so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
Feeling hungry can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating faster than a big bass drum

Yeah you got to mix it child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch
You got to mix it child

I love the sound of pain
The more it hurts the better I feel
The world will fall insane
It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

[Chorus]
Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

[Chorus]

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine
I tell you all it's the way to live
Get stronger on death glory
Infringing on sacrificial rites
Death's your final story

[Chorus]"
172	Exodus	"Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you
Die!

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

More than I can take

You're a habit I don't want to break
Don't want none of that hard stuff
Don't need it anymore

To far gone to escape

Say that we could never beat the the odds

As the pressure surges through our heads so strong
The heavy side of life
Keeps us going day by day
Our enemies we won't forgive
Condemn them to a life of pain

[Chorus]
Can't you guess what this has done to us?
It gave us power! It's a way of life!
There's no separation
Total annihilation
Crushing through creation
'Til death do us part!

Gathered crushing force of one
Eluding all the basic obstacles
But we're all in this game for fun
So say f*ck off to your politics!
We write the songs we want
And spell it out the way it is
Our music is not a front
It's all about the way we live!

[Chorus]"
178	Exodus	"A distant hum
Cuts right through the skies
Calling my attention I look up
I can't believe my eyes
Thousands and thousands
Hungry for our minds
They're biting, eating and controlling
Anything they find

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]
Run-but you can't hide
Blood-coming from inside
My mind-doesn't know wrong from right
Parasite!

A million more
Coming after me
They thrive on insecticide
They live on DDT
No poison can defeat
The never ending swarm
They'll eat you from inside out
You'll wish you were never born

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]

Run-but you can't hide
Blood-sucked from inside
My mind-doesn't know wrong from right
Parasite!

Now they're living in my brain
I'm destroying at their cue
A violent reaction starts within
And now I'm after you!
I'll grab you by your head
And split your skull open wide
The infestation in complete
You're dead but yet alive!

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind

On it's knees

Provide the light we crave

[Chorus]
Turn to look at Baphomet
From below and not above
Welcome to my sacrifice
Tonight there'll be no love

The darkness is my lover
She makes he feel strong
Take what I want, when I want
At night I do no wrong
When I walk the streets
Got Loki on my side
Slit your throat, drink your blood
Who cares when others die

[Chorus]

You thought you'd live for oh 50 long
Now it's your turn to die
Live with Satan down in Hell
Born to forever cry
Took your life I don't feel bad
Born to live in hell
Died for nothing, slow decay
Your body starts to smell"

Buffalo
Court is adjourned, for his honor's

Make enough money for a thousand
Foot yacht
Who in Hollywood
Did they every acquit?
Just senile, judicial idiots
As the drama unfolds
And the law he upholds
If you look real close
You could see him growing mold
Small claims messiah
Is only a pariah to be ridiculed
Objection Overruled!

All rise as he takes the bench
To hear his old voice make my
Gut wrench
Silence to those who are in his court
I'm found guilty by his report
No washed-up judge can say to me
The shit he throws around when
He's on TV
What can he fucking do, throw me in jail?
I'd slap out his dentures, post them
For bail!
Hang up your robe 'cause you're

Being kicked to the curb
Every time you open your mouth
Your try to get in the last word
Those who live in glass houses
Should not be throwing stones
It all comes crashing down
You never left well enough alone

Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve

So many excuses
Always laying the blame
You're always pointing the finger
Adding fuel to the flame
Another slander, another slur
Another hollow apology
So many verbal abuses
Believe your own mythology

Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve

I'll never be your scapegoat
Quote unquote
Your underling
Red light, left turn, you never learned
A crash fit for a king

Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray

Battle strewn, no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight
Downfall!
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand?
Bonfire of the vanities and spite

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sewn
When all the marble palaces
Are blackened, sacked and burned
Will we understand man's ignorance
Through all the lessons learned?

Fall!
Fall!
Fall!
Downfall!

So quick to claim the credit due
Yet no one takes the blame
Like Nero played his violin
While watching Rome in flames
Implosion of our nations through
Decisions of its kings
Downfall of our creation
It's the end of everything

Siege engine revving and coming to atone
Poisonous black smoke billows from its eyes
Unholy war machine can't be compromised
Fueled by the corpses feted fleshed
Never turning back forward to the death
Its only mission is killing everything
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

So inhuman you don't speak its name
Its artillery sets the world aflame
Mechanical demon rolling 'cross the sand
Blood stained thing scorching black the holy land
Skin made of iron, heart made of steel
Lubricated by the blood beneath its wheels
Reclaiming the world for its king
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine!"

Don't try to fight the power surge
Don't you laugh, for this is not a game
Your powerless, don't resist the urge
So many black hearts answering the call
Legions of the musically possessed
Congregations joining in our free-for-all
Unleashing all the rage they've repressed

[Chorus]
Come to us
Succumb to lust
Giving in to our ministry of sin
You know the drill
Do as you will
Dance like the demons of the din
All will yearn
For our nocturne
The dawning of our cult is at hand
Come and pray
We know the way
Bow to the tempo of the damned

We are all leaders of the horde
Keepers of the apes of wrath
Heed the call of the volume lord
High priest of the bloodbath
Serve unto us, surrender us your souls
And great rewards you'll receive
And when the tempo has taken the control
Even the heretic's will believe

Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War
War
War
War is my shepherd

Hate it if we can't comprehend it
Kill it if we don't understand it
Pray to god and your fate is sealed
As you die alone in the killing fields

Dragging me into the fray
Take you out, right you off, there's never enough
Ways to throw you away

'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist

You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out, write you off, when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris

[Chorus]

For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man

Another hit, just one more blast
How long can you make it last?
Hit the pipe and vaporize
Feel the rush, so energized
Your longs being to crystallize
Try to stem the tide
From another five day ride
Don't you know your dead inside?
The world spins out of control
All amped up, nowhere to go
A glass house is all you know

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Spun and sleep deprived
The calendar burns before your eyes
Another hit, for now revived
So many sleepless nights
Only whet your appetite
Strike a match, the torch ignites
See the shards start cracking back
Watch them turn your world to black
While waiting for the heart attack
All your dreams are dead and gone
I tell you now, it won't be long
Before death ends this marathon

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Withered and sucked up
You're wasting away
Eyes sunken deep in your skull
You care not about yourself
Nor any other
Only if the pipe is full
Lick your lips
As you hover around the glass
Anxiously awaiting your turn
Depressed and paranoid
It's all gone to hell
Inhale as your world burns

Lost everything you own
Now waiting by the telephone
For the dope man to come home
All your friends and family
Are sickened by your need for speed
Only driven to exceed
So many years, so little time
For you to halt your life's decline
You've got to read the signs
Everything has come unwound
You've got to turn this shit around
Before you're six feet underground

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!"
194	Exodus	"Brainwashed into madness,
Your children are killers without fear
Manipulate and dominate,
Stealing their lives for your hate
Twisted perverted minds,
Think as we do or you die
Demagogue, fanatical tyrant
A false prophet seething with lies

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Propagation of violence
Your one god a disease upon man
Execution, crucifixion
The answer for those not in your plan
The penalty for contempt against your god
Is death and nothing else
Ignorant infidels
Are subhuman and will all burn in hell

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Smite the perverts and the obstinate
Praising the death of the free
United States of Islam
That's what you would like it to be
Violate the unbelievers
Praising crimes against man
Human rights mean nothing
Doctrine of death a scourge upon man

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god"
195	Exodus	"Let not the sun go down on my wrath
I let it shake the world
Vengeance is the grudge I bear
Flag of reckoning unfurled
You are the architect
Of your own demise
So smile no more
I am the gatekeeper,
And you are mine for evermore

[Chorus]
Come greet the reaper
You know the time is nigh
This is the day of reckoning,
Your time to die
Brave men they spin in fear
At the sound of my voice
Say goodbye to life so dear
You no longer have a choice

Burnt black and silent,
Rust and blood
Upon my reaper's blade
I come collect the tolls
Gather up all the debts unpaid
I call when you least expect
But when you deserve it the most
Behold the timekeeper
The end is getting close

[Chorus]

The dead no longer have
A cross to bear
The dead no longer have
Need to despair
Death has come
And set the snare
Death will come
When you are unaware

The misbegotten have the gall
To think them safe and sound
They try to cheat the reaper
Scatter, hide, no matter, found
The wheel of life is standing still
For them it turns no more
Now comes the soul keeper
And you become my whore

[Chorus]"
196	Exodus	"Man creates the god
And the god destroys the man
Betrayed by their own invention
The shepherd butches the lamb
A lion at the head of an army
Of sheep when comes time to feed
Like Saturn devoured his children
They’re consumed by belief

[Chorus]
I am the chosen one
And I hold the key
Behold the prodigal son
This good I do lives long after me
Let iconoclasm set you free

Christ is the same yesterday
And today, forever a lie
They concocted the heavens
To keep all the puppets in line
Narcotic, addictive desire
To believe they won’t go to hell
A dog that has bitten its master
That it once knew so well

[Chorus]

Figment of imagination
Oracle of ignorance
Corrupter of society
Killer of reason and innocence
An object of man’s creation
Made to fill the hole inside
But that abyss has only been opened wide

Wolves they guard the flock
And they slaughter the sick and the weak
Sorrow is all that they find
When salvation is all that they seek
The truth is the greatest lord
Where no fool commands the wise
Religion ten times undone
No room for compromise

[Chorus]"
