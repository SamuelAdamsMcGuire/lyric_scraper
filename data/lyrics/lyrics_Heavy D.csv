Yea this is uh Super funk you know what I'm sayin
This is for all the players and playetts wherever you at you dig
I'm talkin about from this side to that side 
East side, West side, your side, my side
It's all about being funky man
Aiyyo give me that microphone
It's Heavy D the baritone and I'm home alone dig it 
and I'm always staying freshly dipped on 1-2-5th 
where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin spliff
Okay okay okay okay it's Heavy D again
Hallelujah I'm on your T.V. screen again
You see me on your MTV and on your BET 
and on your local focal point video show
Nigga this how it flow so fly like an eagle
No sequels no weed but I get love from all the thugs 
cause they still my people 
I'm dynamic punks panic when they see me
They get all shook up when my mic's hooked up 
Let's get it on! 

[chorus]x2 
Untouchables at your door 
(Let's get it on) 
All you wack rappers hit the floor 

[2pac]
How should I plead forever thuggin on a quest to get G's
Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin
thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't want to see me stackin G's
They after a playa but I won't let em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine 
I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down the four-five beware of stangers 
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me 
before the penitentiary 
Let's get it on!! 

[chorus]x2 
Untouchables at your door 
(Let's get it on) 
All you wack rappers hit the floor 

[Grand Puba]
I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do 
I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!"" 
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps 
and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody want to see 
but them youth don't trouble we 
because they fall victim to what they see hey! 
I keeps it +Reel to Reel+ like my last album title song 
but I understand it takes a year for niggaz to catch on
(hit em in the head dog) So let's get it on! yea 

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to 
get wicked in the joint uh Notorious is glorious 
*cough, cough)*
Niggaz now who's the mind blower, the weed grower 
Have you seeing doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower 
B.I.G. top notch with the glock check your pockets 
and your sock it's just the way my pops taught me 
When you throw the drop check em thoroughly 
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight
Reminiscin on my swingin days 
when I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yea she had the Gucci boots I had Sarducci suits
Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin Bucktown
Mac-11 cocked back niggaz better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it on"
2	Heavy D	"[Chorus]
It was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more
And it was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more

Well did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh 
Is not the ending to life fear not of the Anti-Christ

Did you know that I exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear Jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls

Your bodies just a vehicle transporting the soul
It's what's inside people, is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil, every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

[Chorus]

It is told that once this greasy order
Is form it comes into a young man's world
And two of dem is like a soldier
That joins the thunder is a wonder

One's attack is like a blunder
One is luckily a stranger
Dem both was born like Jesus inna manger
So join the thunder that's savin' our world

A vester on his chest and Rastafarian is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got, lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not, do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames, same blood that runs through my veins

Watch for sticks and stones stumbling blocks and piles
Life is one big road miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
And most people don't even smile there's a natural mystic

Blowing in through the air so keep it realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and clear, 
But most people won't even hear spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin, a light skin
Like the type of girl that stays busy all day

But when the sun goes down
She's my sexy soufle
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work it
If you try to disrespect her face

Around and get her feelings hurt
She ain't [unverified] from your [unverified]
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it, a
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous

She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight [unverified] from her mack

But she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I like it, yeah, my black coffee

Roars like a lion and when I stroke her kitten
Versatile when the coke gets mine
She got a positive style ain't had none in a while

Party animal but Biggie only when she with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about, hey

Fancy here, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip
A closet full of gear so you know she stay [unverified]

Body so smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some old sex potion
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy

Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step

Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable, the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be alarmed but I'm sewing up the resident
With my particular style-style, particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing up lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-cola with it
Doing very well 'cause I took the right road to this
Path
Maker, undertaker, record breaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'ma end it with a bang (yo)

(Hey!) picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Meanwhile I'm lampin', feelin' like a champ and
Push up on a cutie, phone digits I'm stampin'
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumpin' in stereo
People said, ""Here we go""
A cutie down in front said
""Heavy, you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
There's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Love is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Flipping on the mic makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, 'cause you couldn't even hang (yo)
We got our own thang

We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously 
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face, and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus; tell 'em we're twin porche's

How my Lord, He keeps making a way

Won't He make everything alright
Won't He make everything alright
Alright, alright, alright
He'll make it alright

Me and my wife tried to have a child
But all the doctors in town they just counted us out
It's been eight years in the making and I'm glad to say
I got me a little girl and another one on the way

He'll make it alright

In the valley low
I'll tell the world
Everywhere that I go
He'll make it alright

12	Heavy D	"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say cuff
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya' know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha
Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum diddly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So I blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)"
13	Heavy D	"Poetically inclined, put in good order
I keep a party filled like a bucket of water
When Heavy's in the house, all the girls go crazy
Fellas that are jealous say, ""Man, you amaze me!""
But all you need is the secret I keep
You grab a girl, gain some weight so she can squeeze the beat
Say ""Hey good lookin"" with the sweetest position
""Get inside the car so I can crank the ignition
You got some trouble, I handle him fo' ya
We cruise around in my BMW""
You got to have the voice to make the people jumpy
I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from three
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin', The Boyz are hop-hippin'
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin'
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin' till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin' all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin' party people performer
Cold gettin' paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide 
From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin'
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin' and rhymin', flyin' and climbin'
To the top where stars are shinin'
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin' is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?) 
I'm chunky but funky

Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable, the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be alarmed but I'm sewing up the resident
With my particular style-style, particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing up lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-cola with it
Doing very well 'cause I took the right road to this
Path
Maker, undertaker, record breaker

In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Meanwhile I'm lampin', feelin' like a champ and
Push up on a cutie, phone digits I'm stampin'
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumpin' in stereo
People said, ""Here we go""
A cutie down in front said
""Heavy, you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
There's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Love is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Flipping on the mic makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, 'cause you couldn't even hang (yo)

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

I'll search low and I'll search high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
My destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again

They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debating and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
Nothing

It seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?

I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never find
They also say that love is blind

It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me for me

(I know you want love)
Love, that's what I'm talkin' about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for

(Maybe if you take your time)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Yo, Eddie F. break it down

Yeah, aight, here we go
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber

I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
'Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me"

I'm on point what?

Days and days, blazing green shades of sticky haze
Remember Eightball from doin' it the player way
Turn it up and we gon' rock it 'till the track stops
Make the club seem hotter than a crack spot

Players pushin' poetry like it's a kilo
Keep my jewelry froze like my name's Sub Zero
Pimp 'till I'm gone, thug, living ain't new to me
Love me a ghetto girl and everything she do to me

Presidential suites and Bezo's turn 'em out
Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out
How you lovin' that icin' on the cake right
Miami girls hit that white and shake it all night

Slab riders, chrome twinkies smokin' sticky, iced pinky
With some styles flipping with me
Memphis, let me break it down for you, pal
Makin' easy money pimping hoes in style

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball

You on point, Heavy
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

It's me, BP
From the middle of Little Italy
With Eightball and Heavy
Diddly diddly diddly dee

It's no surprise how we pulverize
All you smaller guys
Fronting that you live but we oversize

Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best

Take time to perfect every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
No time for them chicks
They be tryin' to resist, every time I insist
They submit, bitch, don't be lying on my prick

I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Would you rise in my direction?
If you strive for perfection
And just watch the pro but it's like a chore

You gotta cap and go feelin' for more
Catch me next time, I gotta rock a show
Gots to go, I'll be back and some other fat chick
Peace to the Bronx, a mother in this rap shit

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball

You on point, Heavy

(Hey!) everybody, shake your body
We don't ill, we chill at a party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable, the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be alarmed but I'm sewing up the resident
With my particular style-style, particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing up lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-cola with it
Doing very well 'cause I took the right road to this
Path
Maker, undertaker, record breaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'ma end it with a bang (yo)

(Hey!) picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Meanwhile I'm lampin', feelin' like a champ and
Push up on a cutie, phone digits I'm stampin'
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumpin' in stereo
People said, ""Here we go""
A cutie down in front said
""Heavy, you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
There's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Love is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Flipping on the mic makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, 'cause you couldn't even hang (yo)
We got our own thang

Still classic, only thing changed, new glasses

Could ever touch D Daddy, got plenty pennies
And you can see D on yo' TV set
With somethin' fabulous draped around his neck
I went from, nuttin' to some'n, frontin' to bluffin'
To havin' fancy vegetables like cabbage and carrots/karats
I went from Timex to Rolex, from no sex to mo' sex
Deep in the game like what? (Like what?)
And everybody know my name like what? (Like what?)
Like what? (Like what?) Like what? (Like what?)

Imagine, Daddy baggy, shorties from beauty pageants
I had 'em braggin', like Heavy tried to talk to me
Whips exquisite, Benz wagon
Chicks do visit, I've been bangin' pretty ones for free
Woo! All up in you, like flu (what?)
And when I pass through you gon' shake yo' ass too
Back, it's the boss with the platinum cross
(Uh-huh uh-huh) Platinum Porsche, I'm goin' platinum of course
Heavy keep you dance (you keep me dancin')
Do Heavy keep you movin' (you keep me movin')
Ain't no, pretendin' in me, shorty bring your fender to me

But I've been doing that these kids is new to that
Come inside my crib all you see is platinum plaques
Keep the gold ones in the back cause I'm ashamed of that
Now I lounge in the sticks dime piece on my hip
And I've been doing that since big stuff in eighty six
Something about you really turned me on and I can't figure you out
Cause everyday I'm thinking about diggin' you out, what's that about?
I got visions of turning you out
Now I ain't like mike I'm simply just Dwight Arington Myers
Got a grip like pliers keep my name of the wires cause my crew is high flyers
And I got more ice and more cream than bryers you want to try us?

[Chorus]
Something about that thang,
That thang that you do,
Keeps me running back,
Running to you baby I can't imagine
Being without ya can't live without ya baby

Have you ever been treated correctly huh?
You should be glad you connected with d, baby you ready?
Imagine this Hennessey, coat back, drop top,
You and me, one on one buckwildin' non-stop
Flourish you with jew-ell rings real-ly
If you tell me that you do love me sincerely
Take the American express and go shopping
Put your coochie in Gucci cause we ball in the night
Call your girls tell them that your flowing with water
And it's sickening cause this tricking is really out of order                
I'll make you fingers glimmer, ill make your entire attire better
All up in ya liver,make your body quiver
Heav digga damn that, gon be the same nigga you understand that?
My main intent, is to pay your rent
And Imma keep you satisfied, until the day I die alright

27	Heavy D	"Do you ever feel like, gettin' high?
Do you ever feel like, leavin' this world?
Uhh do you ever feel like, you ball by yourself?
Do you ever feel unnecessary? Uh-huh

Don't call me crazy but sometimes I feel like gettin' up
and dancin' in the middle of the night
I need a way to release myself
from all the pain and the pressures in life (one time)
Considered drinkin', but then I started thinkin'
I'd probably drown away my life
Gotta do somethin', too many people frontin'
You see I need a way to get by

[Chorus x2]
That's why I get hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
from dancin' in the middle of the night
Dancin' in the moonlight

Last night I'm cruisin' the Meadows, better known as the ghetto
Seen a shorty named Black
At thirteen he's deep in the drug scene
And there probably ain't no turnin' back
He said dat, momma was smokin', he tired of bein' broke and
poppa locked up and ain't comin' back
I almost cried when he looked in my eyes
and he said he didn't care if he died

[Chorus]

I've been dreamin' for years, cried a river of tears
I can't take it no more
I seen the bible dying
And I don't wanan cry no more (just ain't right)
Too many people pushin' too many people
Hate is just a sequel, cause still nobody's equal
And I find myself lying
'Cause I don't wanna cry no more

Dancin' in the moonlight
Said dancin' in the moonlight [x7]

[Chorus]

Dancin' in the moonlight
Said dancin' in the moonlight"
28	Heavy D	"I'd like to dedicate this song
To everyone who's cried before
Who's felt pain and suffering before
This just ain't about me
But most importantly I'd like to send this song out to my family
I love my family
'Specially my mother and my father
I wanna thank you for being so strong
God bless you, I love you

Sometimes I sit back, relax, sip on Cognac, reminscin'
on how it used to be, when we were kids
Laughin' at the things that we did (uh-huh)
Damn near broke but we knew how to live, peep the scene
Mom and dad, bustin they ass, fourteen years
In the night they would pass, each other
Tryin' to raise six of us one sister, four brothers
Two deceased, laid to rest
And I miss you cats, what I wouldn't give to bring you back
To fill the void that you left in my heart
Your last breath really tore me apart
And I'm sorry if I never said I loved you enough
I truly did

[Chorus]
Ask, heaven, heaven is there room for me?
Cause I believe, that's where you'll be
Waiting for me, at the end of a stairway to heaven

Aiyyo I swear to you, I'll put it on the bible, no lie
On the days you guys died, I seen daddy cried
I was shocked, y'all know how tough pop is (f'real)
But he really turned soft when life stopped his kids (damn)
Speakin' of kids? Yours - beautiful
Promisin', beautiful, I wish you could see 'em
So much of life, with a touch of yo' light
And I'm doin' my best, to make sure they alright
When I was young, some big kids stole my bike

Came home and told y'all and had it back that night
When I was older you started smokin' and you sold my bike
I remember cause I cried all night; I wasn't mad
I was sad cause the crack had control of your life
And you couldn't even put up a fight
You told me Dwight, I promise lil' brother, I'ma make it alright
You left home, and you died that night - damn I miss you

[Chorus]

Thanksgiving day, came home, surprised the family (surprise)
Walked inside the crib, the mood was wrong (damn)
I heard my moms in the background screamin' on the phone (dad what's goin on?)
I rushed to get closer like yo mom, what's wrong?
She said your brother's buggin' out, hurry up, take a look
I grabbed my brother Floyd and we started to book (run run)
It wouldn't take long, he lived right around the block
I tried to stay strong, but I was shakin' a lot (I'm scared)
Got there, ran up the stairs, he was stretched out in the lobby
A 7-year jail bid physique graced his body
I fell to my knees, like no Jerry please
I was frightened, he was fightin' to breathe
Mumblin' somethin' ""Heav' don't let 'em take me I ain't ready to leave""
I felt his clutch on the cuff of my sleeve, then it eased
He felt calm, as he died in my arms
OD's off of heron, and just like that, he was gone
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, ma you hear me?
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, I love you"
29	Heavy D	"Yeah Yeah (Heavy D: Uh huh)
Eightball the fat mack in the house you know what I'm talking about 
(Heavy D: Big Shots)
Space Age representing you know what I'm talking about 
(Heavy D: You feel this?)
Big Pun up in here you know what I'm talking about 
(Heavy D: Uh)
Heavy D, (Heavy D: Eightball is you ready my nigga)
Fat Mack, (Heavy D: Big Pun is you ready my nigga)
We gonna do this you know what I'm talking about 
Sure, poor, bloor, this how we do 
(Heavy D: Hev Digga born ready my nigga)
Heavy D, set it up

Big gentlemen
Asshole full of Benjamins
New millennium
New Bentley then, a sort addition
Gorgeous women
Swimming in 'em
Cinnamon with denim
Diva pigeons
Peep the glissin'
Why'all don't listen
See what you missin'
Diggy, double shot a henny
All about the ammo NeY
Bubble like no any
Diamond lipped
Crucifix
Seducing chicks
Selective whips
Consecutive hits
I break sun with Pun
Crew hall with Ball
Screw all of why'all
We the big shots
Heavy rotation
Every location
Smoke stogies with roadies on the corner in front of Bodega's
World famous
You gon' love us or hate us
You the type that'd scuff up my gators
Because of my papers
Been about my glitter
So you killin' my jaw
Damn can't a nigga live homeboy?

[Chorus x4]

You on point Hev(Heavy on 4th repeat)
[Heavy D]
I'm on point Pun
You on point Ball
I'm on point what

Days and days
Blazing green shades
Of sticky haze
Remember Eightball from doin' it the player way
Turn it up and we gon' rock it 'till the track stops
Make the club seem hotter than a crack spot
Players pushin' poetry like it's a kilo
Keep my jewelry froze
Like my name's Sub Zero
Pimp 'till I'm gone thug living ain't new to me
Love me a ghetto girl and everything she do to me
Presidential suites and Bezo's turn 'em out
Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out
How you lovin' that icin' on the cake right
Miami girls hit that white and shake it all night
Slab riders, chrome twinkies
Smokin' sticky
Iced pinky
With some styles flipping with me
Memphis, let me break it down for you pal
Makin' easy money pimping hoes in style

[Chorus]x4

It's me, BP
From the middle of little Italy
With Eightball and Heavy
Diddly diddly diddly dee
Its no surprise
How we pulverize
All you smaller guys
Fronting that you live but we oversize
Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best
Take time to perfect
Every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
""I don't got time for them chicks""
They be tryin' to resist
Every time I insist
They submit
Bitch don't be lying on my prick
I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Hold your eyes in my direction
If you strive for perfection
Just watch the pro
But its like a chore
You gotta cap and go
Feel the most
Catch me next time I gotta rock a show
Got's to go
I'll be back and some other fat chick
Peace to the Bronx, a mother in this rap shit

[Chorus]"
30	Heavy D	"Hola mama (hola papa)
Como estas? (bien y tu?)
Chillin, you look good (you too papi)
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

Yeah, por favor
Right, uhh, yeah, yeah
Check check
Yo, check me, check me, uh - yo

[Chorus]
Such a long way to go, but I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam, but I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly

Right, right, yo, yo
I met her at the Copa, Cabana (how she look?)
Word to mom she bananas, I swear I wanna slam her
Like Tito Santana, can't wait to wrestle her
Curious about the sex in her, Gabbana dress on her
Next to her, this cat champagne sippin', ice drippin'
Roleys on the cuff, but she winked at Big Stuff
""How you doin papa?"" I'm just chillin' mama
Loungin' - ""Smokin' on your Cubana?""
Si, the, first name Heavy
She started rubbin' on my big belly, stay put
I can see how you got these other dames shook
'Cause from the first look, a nigga like Water was hooked
She said the name was Carmelita, boricua, from Puerto Rica
Tu eres, mi amiga, senorita?
Me and you friends baby, me and you friends
""Si somos amigos""

[Chorus]

Hu-huh, yo
You the flyest lady in the house ""true"" hear Heavy out
Wanna make you scream ""uh-huh"" wanna make you shout ""okay""
Let me feel this real, baby we can chill
Week in Brazil, D keep it real ""mmm""
Sleep in the hills, native of the 'Ville
Native of Jamaica, steady makin paper ""aight""
See all the linens be crushed plus the gators
Smoke Cuban, gruff smoke Garcia Vegas and dutches
Did world tours, ten buses ""what""
Live life deluxest, some friends is hustlers
And them the type of cats that will spend ends to touch ya
See me I wanna love ya, just flow with Diggy
And I'm always thinkin' of ya, that's word to Biggie
Let's blow this joint and splurge the city, damn you pretty ""gracias""
And them niggaz over there can't stand you with me
Mamita, um beso, por favor
""Por que?"" Por favor mama, por favor

[Chorus x2]"
31	Heavy D	"Good evening ladies and gentlemen

Dig it (aowwwwwww!) C'mon
See you? You be frontin' a lot uh-huh
You the type of chick to bring the heat to the spot
Cats be like whoa, when you out on the block
'Specially when it's hot, you like the neighborhood watch
See me? I'm impressed with that
How you sound, Diggy bound to get next to dat
Guaranteed don't care, when I'm sexin' dat
What'chu think? One wink, and I'm smashin' dat
Now why you wanna go and flirt with D?
Boyfriend all mad, he musta heard about me
Tell me who you know flip licks like this
Piss Crist' like this, with a dimepiece miss

[Chorus]
I know, you love me
Tell them they can't touch me
You're big and, you're sexy
I know, you love me

See you? You be frontin' a lot uh-huh
Runnin' off your mouth in the gamblin' spot
You the type of dude that'll get cats knocked
Snitchin' to cops, you be bitchin' a lot blah blah
Talkin 'bout, Heavy don't keep it real
Well why don'tcha stop tellin', and keep it real in jail
See me? I just play my lane
Baptize my game, fraternize with dames
Diamond lit crucifix, dangle from chains
Simple and plain, I'm handlin' thangs
When it's warm, put my minks in the freezer
Bodyguard, two divas, with the two heaters in the two-seater
Diggy gon' spread like germ
When it's my turn I jiggle my worm, wiggle like sperm
Watch me Bus like Bettis, I got a cheddar fetish
Because I heat up yo' spot, you gon' feel me a lot
H-E, A-V, Y-D
And I'll be damned, if you ain't lovin me, c'mon

[Chorus x2]
I know you love me"
32	Heavy D	"If you think, you gon' waste, my, time (baby)
I don't think so

Ready to come in on that one
Uno, check me out, yo

See I know how you get down
You want a nigga to put down before you go down
Always hangin around
In front of everybody, showin off yo' body
How'd you get in Puffy's party, or need I ask?
You shook yo' thing at me, playin yo' games with me

[Chorus]
If you think, you gon' waste, my, time (baby)
I don't think so baby I don't think so
Cause if you think, you gon' change, my, mind (baby)
I don't think so no baby that's a no no

I see you on the corner frequently
You and yo' bum friends be hatin me (true)
Because I'm makin G's
A nigga don't owe you a thing
So now you studyin my personal
and my platinum thing
Stupid you ain't phasin D
And all that talk you talk you ain't amazin me

[Chorus]

Don't stop, give it to me daddy
Don't stop, Heavy give it to me

34	Heavy D	"Ha ha, yeah, Big Bub, nine seven
Yo, Latifah, do you...

[Queen Latifah]
We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously 
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face, and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus; tell 'em we're twin porche's

[Big Bub]
Girl, I am diggin' you
You're diggin' me
Let's make this happen
The things I want to do to you 
Your mind just can't imagine

So, baby, won't you be my lady?

Take you higher like an elevator
And here's the bottom line
No one can ever love you better
If you like what you're hearing 
Girl, let's get together

I want your love (oh yeah)

You take some time and vibe with me
Now jump in the car and ride with me
She said: ""water bed, I like when you inside of me.""
'Cause you belly all big, and you so fly to me
Now shorty takes trips and various whips
Her phone flips; likes style lavish
Playin' the cabin
Word the mother 
That's my nigga, Big Bub

Whoa baby, yeah

You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head 
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute 
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie

Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feel me creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right

Uhh, make ya comfortable, big lovable, what??

No diggity, here I is boo, what?
[Singer] Cause it feels good
Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy, uhh, uhh, uhh

You got me open like a book, shook, by the way you look
I see you in your whip dipped, couped, fully equipped
Diamonds shinin', earring studded, watch flooded with jew-els
It seems to me as if you might be livin' it well
New York to Cali, be in and out of town, body by Bally's
I like the way you flex, I wonder 'bout the sex
What next? Miss, you remind me of a spliff
I mean you smokin', no jokin', and I'm hopin' you get with this
My previous dames, played devious games
Wanted a piece of my livin', so I dismissed the pigeons
However I stay concurrent with leathers in cold weathers
Forget Batman, I guess it's Fat-man forever (and)
I keep peepin' yo' game, you don't be creepin' the same
You smooth, you don't even move like them other dames
They out your reach as you be on blue beaches sunnin
You keep shinin like a ring I do my thing and keep it comin

And I be Heavy D yo' in between the sheets lover
It seems to me that you ain't ready to be
Better you be with he, steady you frontin on me, listen
My main concern is long term
I like you cause you're full of jokes high hopes plus that indo you smoke
I feel your, tattoo of who you used to do, now you regret it
Don't sweat it boo, I know it was a long time ago, now feel me
I live the saga, hip-hoppa's, Don Dada
Dem fools talk about it, but rules I be about it
You out their reach as you be on blue beaches sunnin'
You keep shinin' like a ring I do my thing and keep it comin'

Aww Heavy (aww Heavy) {I hear you talkin' baby}
Keep on comin' {I keep it comin' ma, I keep it comin' mami}
Keep it comin' {ya don't stop, big lovable, make you comfortable}

Good to the, last drop da-da
Don't stop is what you tell me, anything to swell me
Private dancin', romancin' the soul
On the telephone you be like ""poppa come home""
Right now I got 30 minutes of foreplay
Thirty minutes of straight sex, nine minutes of rest, now add that up
Mink rugs, bearhugs, hot tubs
Get lifty off the bubs, is what she loves
Go 'head baby

Shorty blender, fender bender, back twirler
Boo twister, officially, sexually
I'm Mr. me be always ready, in jacuzzi
Ahh, baby, do me, do me
Fantastic, romantic, none equivalent
To my tactics, get at this, who want it?
Some get champagne, you know how they be trippin'
But the joke really on you boo, cause sippin' keep you strippin'
(Go 'head baby) Now dance for me, keep romancin' me
You got no chance with me, but you want my hands to be

Yo, Latifah, do you...

We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously 
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face, and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus; tell 'em we're twin porche's

[Big Bub]
Girl, I am diggin' you
You're diggin' me

Her phone flips; likes style lavish

Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head 
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute 
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I spend quality time 
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feel me creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right

Game ear tight why you caught up in the hype
That's right that's miggie, miggie, biggie
Baby your ready for big daddy

Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign
Boo be all that and then some
Job all that mad income
Hand New Yorkers wish you represent from
24-7 you the one that I be sweating
You and time that's no question couldn't be nothin' less than
Sexually the best next to me I confess
You got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty
Nothin' could compare to you Boo I swear to you 
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you

You walk like talk like sexy

You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign

If you want it you can have it
Baby come and get it
I'll be right here waiting for you
(Take your time, everything'll be fine)
If you need it you can get it
Anyway you want it
I'll be right here waiting for you

Uhh, straight off the top, I refuse to stop
Chicks cling when I do my thing I got it locked
Officially, I'm yo' big belly da-ddy
Technically, you don't need to be with nobody but me
Ha-va-na ci-gar, Ja-mai-can ni-gga
6 Benz, Cartier tint lens, what?
I dig yo' steez, knock knees, trunk full
Body all lumped up, lifestyle Trumped up
Platinum blonde, hazel eyes chinky
Diamond on the pinky, skin bronze, you with me?
She, good'n'plenty, Benz E-320
Me, I pull over, drop that red Range Rover
Shorty was milkshake thick, sportin' silk, mink and
She had it sewn, flowin' on her own
She's the type of girl to put her crew on the map
Anything you want, don't wet that, you can get that

[Chorus]

Now let me speak about this chick I call hotter than a flame
Seen her chattin' with this dame, I had to go and get her name
She with her friends, they at the bar gettin' they drinks on
Outfit's off the hook with ice gold links on
Way the skirt is fittin' black, who hittin' that
I'm kickin' game up in my head steadily sittin' back (I feel ya)
Now I'm think in the attempt to attack the
Shorty that I'm lookin' at that's lookin' at me
But soon enough I get my nerve up
{?} passes me a drink as Pretty Lou he sparks the herb up
I'm with my Uptown team, makin' noise
Heavy D, Soul IV Real and Lost Boyz
Now I feel it's time to go and get my try on
And take shorty home that I got my eye on
Anything that you want you can catch that
Like my man said, don't sweat that

[Chorus]

By the way mama
Last night the club was tight, shorty's dead right
But you stood out the most, so I had to play you close
Nuttin' less than, black essence, your presence real strong
Dudes all around you frontin' hard, gettin' they trick on
I ain't mad, I just watch you gas 'em up, then I watch you pass 'em up
Then I step up, now look, you shook
You stuck, what's yo' name, what's yo' digits, what'chu drinkin'
My treat and when they steppin' you get swept up off yo' feet
My mission, first position, backs I twist 'em listen
Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy
The all-star, dapper rapper
In conjunction with the funk that keep it blazin' out they trunks
What'chu want, sky's the limit, I live it, now is you wit it
Slow flow, Poconos style, I mean I'm chillin'
Top billin', anything you want, anything you need
Don't wet that boo, you can get that true

Right now I got 30 minutes of foreplay
Thirty minutes of straight sex, nine minutes of rest, now add that up
Mink rugs, bearhugs, hot tubs
Get lifty off the bubs, is what she loves
Go 'head baby

[Chorus] 

Shorty blender, fender bender, back twirler
Boo twister, officially, sexually
I'm Mr. me be always ready, in jacuzzi
Ahh, baby, do me, do me
Fantastic, romantic, none equivalent
To my tactics, get at this, who want it?
Some get champagne, you know how they be trippin'
But the joke really on you boo, cause sippin' keep you strippin'
(Go 'head baby) Now dance for me, keep romancin' me
You got no chance with me, but you want my hands to be
(right here) Say what, and when you want it
(right now) Say what, and where you want it
(right here) Yeah, know why?
'Cause you'll always be singin' this Heavy D song
[Girl] Oooh, right there
That's right

I hear you talkin' mama (go 'head baby)
And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
I hear you talkin' boo-boo (go 'head baby)
Feel me out y'all (go 'head baby)
And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Move it momma (go 'head baby)

Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Break it, break it (go 'head baby)
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Move it momma (go 'head baby)"
47	Heavy D	"Baby, I've got many problems
But my momma won't help me solve them
So I come to you (you you)
But your ass don't wanna be bothered
So I come around don't wanna be bothered
So I come around trying to be down
But you're acting like a silly clown
Ask me for $50
Said to myself
Well I'll be damned
Why are you trying to give me such a very very hard time
When I spend the money on you
You can't get a little of the bump and grind
There must be another man (man), holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me
Baby, baby
I will

I'm trying to go on without you here in my life
I don't wanna accept the fact that your no longer mine
Just to know there's somebody else who's holding and kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like I'm a fool

So girl, I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am

I'm trying to cope with these emotions everyday (day)
I realize it's too late now you're gone away
Is there something that I can do to reassure
That I won't hurt you like this anymore

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am

So I'll do anything, anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done 
I'm sorry, I'm begging you, I'm begging me

I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
That's my word is (that's my word is bond)
Please forgive me (can't you tell, can't you tell by the look in my eye)
I'll do anything 
That's my word is bond (I like that)
Please forgive me (please forgive me I'm sorry) 
Everything I've done
I'm sorry

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am

48	Heavy D	"I know it's hard to believe, when your eyes just can't see
So lean on Me, I have not disappeared and I can see you from here
Tears are blinding you from the truth
Oh, I'm right here in front of you

Won't you reach out and take my hand
Don't be afraid of love, don't be afraid of love
I'll know you'll find your strength again
Don't lose your faith, don't be afraid

There are questions on your face with no answers in place
So just believe for tomorrow will come and with it, the morning sun
Oh, I hop you will let me in
That's when the healing begins

There's a wall surrounding you
Love alone can make it through
You're caught up in the circle you drew
And when your world starts tumbling' there for you"

Beyond the moon, Jupiter, Mars, the stars

[Unverified] when I speak, watch out when the homey creep
Verbally you heard my name throughout the street
Watch out where you hang homey, be careful where you hang out
No doubt, I'm about my cash, and all about my clout

Heav' Diggy, niggy be jiggy, gruff you wit' me?

All up in yo' frame, Pretty Tone type game, now listen

Lovin' be good 'n' plenty when she sippin' on Remy
Not many like me, I like when you do, what you do
To excite me, it's all about you, then it's all about you

Since you our love child, the stallion of style
You live foul when on the prowl I kidnap the crowd
The raw rough, rugged enough to call bluffs
Ladies try lockin' niggaz down like cuffs

It's off the heezy, girl, I like my hair peasy
(Touch me, tease me)
Girl, take it easy
I hits the spizzy with Heav' Dizzy and Young Daz
You're too young to last wit'cha pretty young ass

Just thought I'd let you know what you're feeling, babe
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?
Do you know what you're dealing with?
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?

Yeah, yo knick knack paddy whack give a Dogg a Pound
Glass of champagne, mix some hydro with brown
Lyrical outlaw, write my rhymes southpaw
Poppin' shit, niggaz get punched in they mouth for

McGruff the Crime Hound, droppin' the nine sound
From New York to out of town be knockin' them dimes down
This is how we do it in the N.Y.C.
All we really love is controversy

I heard you plottin' on my pockets
All this barbershop talk y'all be doin', niggaz stop it
You ain't hurtin' nuttin', you frontin', runnin' 'round here like you real
Then tell me how you feel when you get yo' cap pealed
(You know the deal)

Why you wanna front on me?
This ain't nuttin' new to me, nuttin' you can do me
Shorties dey be true to me, this big fella, high yellow complexion
East coast, west coast connection

Just thought I'd let you know what you're feeling, babe
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?
Do you know what you're dealing with?
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?

I'm just posted, toastin' up, sippin' on a shake
All the moves you make, e'ry step you take
Get you all alone and bend you 'til you break
Wait then give you back to the cat in the cake

Nah, I ain't a sucker, I'm all about my papes
Just 'cause you caught the vapes and tryin' to hang like drapes
Mess around and get your feelings crushed like grapes
I give it all it takes to shake just like quakes

Herb McGruff, Heav' D, Dogg Pound creation
Bet'chu this sound here gon' bump around the nation
Hear it on your radio station
Turn up your stereos, keep your blunts blazin', amazin'

One love to the Harlem Foundation
We be gettin' down, you can tell my town nathin'
About money makin', tired of all these clown niggaz fakin'
Uptown and Dogg Pound will keep the ground shakin'

This is how we roll when I'm comin' through ya town
You lovin' how it sound 'cause we be gettin' down
You can find me at the bar, puffin' on cigar
Preferably Cuban or, sippin' Evian

He the Don, the Don, officially
All the honies want me when they see me initially
One by one I take 'em all individually
And if it's goin' down then we doin' it collectively

Just thought I'd let you know what you're feeling, babe
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?
Do you know what you're dealing with?
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?"

But my man's tell me I ain't got a chance wit'chu
What a nigga gotta do to get a dance wit'chu
Get dipped, take trips, fly to France wit'chu?

Now, I'll be there to keep you warm when nights is cold
Word to God, I swear I'll give you something to hold
See you be on my mind 'cause you shine like gold
To think that I've been knowing you since we was young years old

Drive a nigga crazy wearing stuff like this

Tricking cash and you still gets no love

Running 'round here acting all rah-rah? I'll be chilling and smoking
On my lye, Heav' D and Gruff we stay fly

Won't you take time, see if you chance me
You be like dough slow but Heavy getting Nancy
Some don't really like me, they don't understand me

Midnight, candlelights, hot wax drips on ya back
Dom P, empty, Cristal it's on it's way I don't play
I'm dead serious, aiyyo I mean this
Straight up ugly faces in exotic places

My erotic taste is, outrageous, upstages
The bravest of lovers, but this one's overweight
Waterbed, now get it straight, Sade' CD, killin' me softly
You know Victoria's Secrets but speak it cause you want me

Always lookin' lovely when you walk around my way
My boo be crispy, forever jiggy, forever with me

The Rolex, the lucci, Versace, Coogi, Gucci

Chicks dig me, no question, chicks love me, no doubt
They be all up in my house nigga, now what's that all about?
Here's what I like, 138, that's 69 twice in one night
Who's jiggy, Heav' Diggy, no question
My sessions in sex, leave the honeys perplexed
And I don't mean no disrespect but keep it warm and get ya freak on

Low pros, chrome rims, Manhattan condominium
Now I imagine scoopin' dime pieces at beauty pageants
Protect your fertible, sex convertible, Lex and Rolex

Content, on how to get G's, I know thieves and criminals
Buff thugs who show love, back rubs from dimes and dub
Hotties with narcotic bodies, my style is urgent
A rap merchant, a major player with flavor

Well it's the H E, you see me, A V why, that be me
The dress code a pain, some things never change, huh

You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head 
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute 
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I spend quality time 
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feel me creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right
You be like that its that big man we all up tonight
Game ear tight why you caught up in the hype
That's right that's miggie, miggie, biggie
Baby your ready for big daddy

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign
Boo be all that and then some
Job all that mad income
Hand New Yorkers wish you represent from
24-7 you the one that I be sweating
You and time that's no question couldn't be nothin' less than
Sexually the best next to me I confess
You got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty
Nothin' could compare to you Boo I swear to you 
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you
Might even steal for you 
You walk like talk like sexy
When you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me
You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign

Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it on"
57	Heavy D	"Love somebody

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

I'll search low and I'll search high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
My destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again

They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debating and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
Nothing

It seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?

I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never find
They also say that love is blind

It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me for me

(I know you want love)
Love, that's what I'm talkin' about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for

(Maybe if you take your time)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Yo, Eddie F. break it down

Yeah, aight, here we go
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber

I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
'Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me"

Ugh
Hey, heh ha ha

Tonight is dedicated to you
Do what you want to do, have fun
You call the shots, and it's on me ha HA
Here we go
Bring it onni onni onni onni on one

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
Tonight is your night so do what you want to
Grab a girl, grab a guy, say hi, say ho
Throw your hands in the air and let the music flow
Now here we go, once again it's the man with the wings on the double
Got my shovel and I'm diggin for skins
Now everything is alright, nobody's uptight
Could be the lights but all the girls look right
Now I'm coolin in the corner with a cutie named Judy
and a girl named Sheryl, said she been around the world
Went and strolled on her own through the club on a rub-a-dub tip
tryin to snuggle up wit another honeydip
I see my peoples on the dancefloor doin their thing
As I 'gan to sing, believe me it's a black thing
The party's all jumpin, everything is alright
So do what you want to do 'cause it's your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I need the dancefloor stacked with back-to-back blacks
and blunts to get contact, some stunts to get tumtaps
The night is still young, the fun is still fun
Everybody move your body, it ain't nuttin but a party
Folks can I get a ""ho""? (HO)
Ladies can I get a ""oww""? (OWW) so hear me now
It's a regular routine thing where brothers do their thing
It ain't Arsenio, but it's definitely a night thing
The atmosphere is a rap-most-fear
and everybody from nowhere to somewhere is here
So act like you know, and float with the flow
You heard it on stereo, see it on the video
Everybody's workin up a sweat
Even though roughneck is with the roughneck step
The party's all jumpin, everything is right
So do what you want to do 'cause this is your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I got the goods and the goodies, some brothers be in hoodies
and some girls be in tight jeans, it's part of the night scene
Everybody is freshly dipped
Brothers be at the bar actin like movie stars, set to flip
The whole crowd's in a good groove, eatin the good food
Soul food to keep you in a good mood
Champagne flowin, people hey-hoin
Time just passed without ya even knowin
Party's like pretty sights, late nights
Flexed from a set to the next set, it's aight
The party's only jumpin, everything is tight
So do what you want because it's your night

		[Chorus - The Boyz] x2
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright"
59	Heavy D	"Just when I thought I found me someone I can go with just
When I thought I found me someone I can go with that's
When my girl friend came to me, said she told me that nigga
Ain't nothing I seen him in the club, acting like he won't, no

Where around that's when I found out that you was nothing
For me and all the love that you said that you had
It turned out to be funny and I done gave you the best part
I don't know what else I can do to turn you around no

You got me waiting you got me waiting
When I am telling you everything you
Need to hear like baby, come, now you
Got me waiting but I can't keep waiting
On you acting like whatever I will always

Be around 'cause you think that you
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me, ohh baby, now you got me waiting
But I can't keep waiting on you, ohh

Look at me and tell me now if I can be the last one that that
You think about thinking you, can keep running out my life
My life my life why is it's so hard for you to pick up the phone
And call me put a little time in for me to show that you really care for

Me remember how you used to say
That nothing comes before me
You now it was a lie because you put your
Boys before me promises, promises
Made and broken still I keep
Holding on thinking you would that notice that

You got me waiting you got me waiting
When I telling you everything you need
To hear like baby, come, now you got me
Waiting but I can't keeping waiting on you
Acting like whatever I will always be

Around 'cause you think that you're something
Like a pimp and you can hang in these streets
And it will be all right with me but baby, you
Got me waiting and I can't keep waiting on you

There comes a time in every man's life
Where he has to do everything his girl
Likes because if he don't choose to
Play by the rules I am sure there's
Somebody else out there who just would love

Too do me hold me go the extra mile
Like you did when you was trying to
Get to no me do me hold me treat me
Nice and show me all the things you
Forgot to show me 'cause

You got me waiting got me waiting
When I am telling you everything
You need to hear like baby, come
Now you got me waiting but I can't
Keep waiting on you acting like

Whatever 'cause I will always be
Around 'cause you think that you're
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me you got me waiting but I can't keep waiting on you"

61	Heavy D	"Oh yes this is special
This is direct from what we call The Funk House
This is a total dope phat one, knowhatI'msayin?
And this is how it's done, Uh!

I did good in my hood as a youngster
The Heavster was never a punkster, no sir
No ma'am, hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand
The bigger nigga is back and I'm on the right track
As a matter of fact, I'm all that
So ring around the Rosie, oopsy-daisy
Topsy turvy, you never heard of me you don't deserve me
Fly like Kinievel, drive like a BMW
You never knew I could bring trouble to
a cordless you can't afford this don't get aboard this flavor
Unless you got the fever flavor for a Pringle
Come be a single, let me see you mingle jingle dangle
Sammy Davis Jr. was Mr. Bojangles
(Here is something you can't understand)
Tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man? (The Heavster)
(""Time keeps on slipping"")

Yes, too many brothers be fakin' moves, or frontin' grooves
Peace to all the brothers on the block, drinkin' and passin' brew
Money tried to flip but he got flopped
Said it was his corner let him know his corner's on my block
I know your fantasy, don't Stay, I ain't Jodeci
When I used to juggle y'all was crumbs who didn't notice me
But now you see me in a magazine, on your TV screen
On the radio liver stereo lookin' clean
All of a sudden I'm attractive, I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say you can't afford this
I wreck shops and got props from New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley
Ain't nuttin changed... wait a minute, I'm a liar
The crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two
Who's the man?
Like I said, this here, is official

Back in the day I used to punch clocks now I'm drippin' props
And countin' loot, and shootin' hoops, and lookin' cute
in tailored suits, made for the Over-weight Lover
undercover, over cover
You know my MO I do damn well on the stage show
I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop who's the bigger one, quick to figure one
two, three two one, ah!
Keep a pen and a pad on stash
I used to crab the last, now I flow for dough, and I rhyme for cash
I'm glad to say goodnight to Johnny Carson
And brother where you rub it 'fore you catch the Magic in your Johnson
Honeydips, money grips
I know the difference cause I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Everything here, is phat, knowhatI'msayin?
Don't take it the wrong way, but I'm lettin' you know
For the last time, this here is official
This is fat"

Money-earnin' Mount Vernon, can't forget the uptown
Here we go

Aiyyo turn me loose I don't produce with no buttercup
Premier got the butter cuts, here comes that ol' rugged stuff
No room for no pitty-pat, petty kitty-kat rap
I jig em renege em or give em a dug em diggum smack
I seen you hangin on ghetto blocks, tryin to get ghetto props
You need to stop, you're just a ghetto flop
Here comes niggy-nack piggyback, knapsack sacky
Saki, classic like a Kawasaki, rough like Rocky
Sisters call me dadi Puerto Ricans call me papi
You can't stop me
Uhh, 'cause in these times of tough times
I'm coming with rough rhymes
Rugged beats I'm passin' time on satin sheets
And where I came from, some come from
Tryin' to diss the champion, numba one, Don Gargon
Talkin' behind my back like they alla that, they ain't halfa that
Matter of fact, I'm the one who put the town on the map
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

Uhhh yeah, well alright c'mon

Yeah yes, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

Here comes the bigger bro, I'm on the slow nigga flow
I like to do bigger show, so I can get bigger dough
I hung out in crazy states, sit down and ate crazy steaks
In the morning time I wake up with a rhyme and some Corn Flakes
Rap is a stallion's job, hung out with Italian mobs
I been around the world with pretty girls and they credit cards
Around in the Source van, got paid when my horse ran
And despite the verdict, I'm still a Mike Tyson fan
In the trench I get ruff, on the stretch, I get vexed
Eddie F's on the set who's next to get wrecked
Mr. Sweeperman, time to do the sweep up
Brothers couldn't keep up, spendin' too much time with their feets up
Listen to it, this is how I do it
When I wreck a set rhymes float like fluid
Lord have mercy on those who curse me
You don't appreciate, neither-for you don't deserve me
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick""
Yeah what? Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh talk about it alright yeah

So break it down
""So easy does it on the DL, the Heavster""

Didn't it make you sick when I went pop and I kept my props 
and I blew up the spot and was large on your block
I know it did that's why you formed the committee
Of a bunch of itty bitty silly Milli Vanilli hillbilly niggies
never mind all the chitter chat, cause I got a bigger bat
Step out of line again to get your jaw tapped
Don't try to play me for cream puff
Forgot I was big stuff, rough tough, and all that stuff, huh?
You jabber jaw junkie, rap tour flunkie
Quick at the lip, but when you see me you flip like a monkey
It always amazes me, how some brother's faces be
Smilin' but behind your back they talk like an enemy
But I got a sharper blade, from here I see better days
Sittin' on my porch countin' loot drinkin' lemonade
Swingin' with the shy type, girl who's the fly type
The non gettin high type, that's how you know she's my type
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick"""

Quick to figure and I pack Palladium stadium stands
Rugged raw, clear the floor
R&B hardcore plenty more. been on plenty tours
Been in plenty drawers, far from just okey-doke
Not into no hokey-poke, although I may drink a Coke
Hell no I won't smoke no coke
Steady steady but ready for pitty petty
Big and heavy, far from Chevy, so save your gas for Getti
Mic check it, microphone check it
Watch me wreck it; I'm never half steppin'

Far from a chump, I'm a champ, I get amped
When I run through camps, gimme some plaques on the stamp, HEY
I need a girl who got plenty trunk, who knows I got ghetto funk
Not into blunts but I be on a stunt hunt
Got crazy drama, dramatics, big girls in Bahamas are addicts
So now they cling like static, dig it
I rolled up on some old wonderama type of drama
I'ma, comma, big belly punanny momma harmer
Bag a cute, so NIGHT troops, I'm all about
Two scoops, I cut loose, just me and a few troops
To handle static to me is automatic
I never panic or stall, I'm gigantic so yes, y'all

Uhh, king of the big boys, bigger boys, don't even matter
Save all the chitter chatter, I make em split and scatter
I keep em goin for blocks, I never ran from cops
I roll with my flock, and get props from dreadlocks
I treat a mic like a bad habit, I grab it I gotta have it
A funky junkie flippin styles is automatic
I freak a beat like a prostitute, I'm always in hot pursuit
I'm tryin to get lots of loot, lots of boots
Do jungle rocks like a hustler moving crack
Like a muscl-er microphone damager handin ya rough like a wrang-ler
Sew up cities with girls of pretty, known for the nitty gritty

Brown skinned junior from Africa
Blowin up so it's, possible to freak

Free me, slavery, let me go oh no no no
No longer will you treat my beautiful sisters like they're filthy hoes
Never ran from static men to crew get dramatic
And I get crazy respect from crazy crews with automatics
Now push could come to shove because they love the way I flip a skip
And that's what keeps me kinda popular with all the honeydaps
So look at me now, and tell me who is bigger?
When I'm on the block I'm with my flock and I'm rollin with a buncha niggas

That’s right, this is called the basement!
And my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

From the heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I’m your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my er
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I’m like a mink while you’re soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl
Heavy d’s on this track, lettin' you know there’s no replacement
Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

That’s right, crazy funky
Aw my man
He’s crazy funky, his name is rob-o, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you’ll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, Pete makes beats in the basement
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I’d just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint’s bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the ? 
I hear voices sayin', that’s rob-o’dingo in the basement

Ah ha ha ha! hah yeah! this is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like snoopy, the beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin' raw papes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I’m comin' to town but you just can’t wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin' of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in the basement

In the basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with cl smooth
My man ? ,rob-o, g-r baby pah
The heavster, my brother grap lover
Everybody"
66	Heavy D	"Ah yeah! feel the funk bay-be!
That’s right, this is called the basement!
And my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

From the heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I’m your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my er
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I’m like a mink while you’re soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl
Heavy d’s on this track, lettin' you know there’s no replacement
Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

That’s right, crazy funky

My, my, my love

I was a fool to let you in

From the day your love departed
Now that love you found with someone new is gone
And so you want to come back

I was loving you, kissing you, 
Holding you tight
I wish you know that a woman
That you learn to leave today
And it's a shame that you want to come back now baby

70	Heavy D	"Alright, this one goes out
To all the lovers in the house, know I'm sayin'?
I'm gonna express my feelings right about now
On the way I like to do things, T-are, bring it in

Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, I like it
Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, ooh boy

How would you feel if I worked you down?
Made your head spin like a merry-go-round
Take control like Charles in charge
I really can't wait, let's stay in the garage

Oops, let me run as I get the whipped cream
Can't have ice cream without whipped cream
Plus an ice cube to make you swing
My main man did it, eh, do the right thing

C'mon let me tickle you in all the right places
Keep my eyes open while I watch ya make faces
Feelin' quite dandy, comfortable and cozy
Let me draw the curtains 'cause my neighbors are nosy

So make a little room, here comes big daddy
Big like a truck, satisfyin' like a Caddy
Many will call but the chosen are few
And all I wanna know, is it good to you?

Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, I like it
(Is it good to you?)
Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, ooh boy

Make a move, make a move, my lollipop cutie
Lay down on the cover, let the lover do his duty
It looks like rain but rain doesn't matter
We can take time, hold hands and chit-chatter

And what about love? Love's a possibility
But let's make sure we share the same mentality
Close the door, dim the lights
Everything is okey-dokey, 'cause we set it alright

And how 'bout oil? Warm from the heat
I can slick ya body down from your head to your feet
Make ya smile from a simple kiss
Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish

Open your arms and wrap me tight like a teddy bear
Then take your fingers and run it through' my hair
Many will call but the chosen are few
But all I wanna know, is it good to you?

Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, I like it
(Is it good to you?)
Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, ooh boy, yeah
(Yeah, lay back a little)

You know when we kiss
I really wanna make ya feel right now
I mean, is it good to you?
Cause believe me when I tell you, it feels good to me

Check it, roll over my lover, the sun is beaming
The hot water's runnin' and the bathroom's steaming
Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun

Yeah, we're snuggled up now it's time to buckle up
So call me later, cutie and I'll pick you up
Many'll call but the chosen are few
And all I wanna know, is it good to you?

Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, I like it, yeah
(Is it good to you?)
Is it good to you? I like it
Is it good to you? Ooh, ooh, I like it, yeah
(Is it good to you?)

Is it good to you?
(Tell me baby, tell me baby 'bout it, is it good to you?)

Is it good to you?
I like it, baby"
71	Heavy D	"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
Does she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be	-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'm a let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

(Free Slick Rick)"

I don't want to go outside
I just want to be with you
I don't feel like takin' a ride
You know what I want to do
Girl you makin' me sweat
Come close
Let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

Let it rain 
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and 
Here to move a million plus
Cause when I'm damp i don't rust
Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course 
So precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto
Snuggle
Better yet
Cuddle
Happy like a little kid 
Playin' in a puddle
Of H2O
A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover 
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus] 

Now we can go down stairs
Strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing 
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One two three
Hey yo who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D.
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus

Okey Dokey
Lookin' for a trophy
Giggolo, Romeo
Wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like preacher
Your high school teacher
Just call me your daddy O
Loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid 
But drive a jeep 
not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Before you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin' with the lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden  
I got the tingle fro a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a Pringle
I think I like to mingle 
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see 
how it would be

[Chorus]

Lightning and thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid 
'Cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control
Who needs a grammy 
When you know you got soul
I'm a smooth
Yella
Complexion
Vanilla
High Low
Aphro 
Intelligent fella
You look worried
Does something trouble ya
We can take a ride in my
Heavy D M W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can 
Gimme what you want 
And show me what you got
But for now 
Just snuggle me Snuggle me
Quit the chit chat
Double up and snuggle oven me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see how it would be"
74	Heavy D	"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

(Free Slick Rick...)
"
75	Heavy D	"Here's to you
You have gone through struggles, suffering
This one goes out to everybody in the world, but especially on the street level
Because I know where you comin' from and some of the things you do, I can understand
So through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

What is a friend for? Through rich and through poor
Kinda like a marriage balanced on a different floor
A friend could tell you things that he wouldn't tell another
So in essence, a friend could be considered a brother
You laugh and you play a lot, you talk and you say a lot
But when it's time to feel the pain, you cry and you pray a lot
I'm talkin' about you, you who have the time
A time to be my friend when no one else would be mine
Problems were nothing because I had my man to share them with
Hills were nothing neither, cause I had my man to climb 'em with
I'm really proud to say that I truly really knew you good
And oh, God's blessing from the entire neighborhood
And as the days drift, drift into the future
I laugh a little louder at the times that I was witcha
This one's for you and I truly hope you hear me
And through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x2] 
You'rrrrrrrre on my miiiiiiiiiiiind (You're on my mind)
And I wish you a peaceful journey (Peace!)
Brother I hope you hear me

In the corner, sits the little girl in tears
The shadow of a man overwhelms her fears
""Mommy, mommy, NO!"", the words of a battered child
The wicked, wicked mommy has the sticks swingin' buckwild
""Mister, mister, do you have a dime?
See, I'm hungry and I'd rather be a begger than do crime""
Sure here's your dime, go make a big ten bucks
Now sneak around the corner, get your joints and go beat him up
A kid on the streets, doesn't want to be beat
So he hangs on the block 'til his pop fall asleep
Missing kids on the milk carton
A lunatic kills kids for kicks and gets pardoned
Baby girls run away from home, huh
And two months later, they're stars on child porn
Tracks on the arms of a minor
Suzie ran too, but she'll be dead when they find her
Kids on the street movin' drugs, the thugs' growin' up fast
Wouldn't stop when one gets plunged
Junior stole a Benz with his friends
But got caught, now he's doin' time with twenties and tens
For the rest of his life, he learns to lean on the wall
And prays for the day when his number is called
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x2]

Pardon me, mister warden, I'm askin' for a pass
To come for some of my brothers who made mistakes in the pass
It's really not their fault, you see times are hard
And it was probably difficult for my man to find a job
Before he was forced, forced to make a living
By lying, stealing, and eventually killing
No one was born bad, we're all God's Kids
So who's to really blame for the wrong that he did?
And speakin' about the law, what are they for?
To beat us with a stick face down on the floor?
You preach and you preach that you want crime to stop
If you want crime to stop, stop hiring crooked cops
So hear me brother man, hear my plea!
If you want success all you gotta do is succeed
Love, life, pain, death
What else is left on the travels of life's steps?
In life, we lose, get bumped and bruised
The road you choose not necessarily a cruise
You giggle for joy, shed a tear for pain
There's a lot to lose, and a lot to gain
Though when you walk on the streets, try to walk on street smarts
When you see your man down, try to have a little heart
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x4]

Yeah, you're on my mind
Peace
Hear me now brother

Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your stealing, stop your stealing
Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your killiiiii-ehhhhh-eeeeaaasah
Huurrrrrrrr 
Who!

Take my hand, take my hand
If you need somebody, you can trust on me!
Ha, you can lean on me
Yes, you can errrr-aaaaahh-yaaahyaah"
76	Heavy D	"Is it good to you baby, cause I like it
Is it good to you baby
Cause I like the way you feel

Lay down and relax
Kick off your shoes
I got what you've been waitin' for and more
No more waitin' its time your all mine
So take your time and do 
It right tonight

So if you're ready
And you want it yeah
Come and get it boy
Cause I'm with it
And I won't hold back the 
Feelings I feel
Cause boy its real, so real
So tell me how it feels, baby

Is it good to you baby, cause I like it
Is it good to you baby
Cause I like the way you feel

Oooh, you look so good
Lyin' here
To run my fingers through
Your hair, baby
And if makin' love is your dream
With no other but me
Come and get what you 
Been waitin' for

But take it nice and slow
Don't rush it
Then go round and round
Then push it
Cause I like the way
You feel my body hey
Its feels good baby
So good, but tell me 

Is it good to you baby, cause I like it
Is it good to you baby
Cause I like the way you feel
"
77	Heavy D	"Intro (spoken):

People, 
The world today is in a very difficult situation,
And we all know it,
Because we're the ones who created it.

Chorus:

What's wrong with our future? (4x)

Verse One:

Bust this

How long will this last?
A friend to the end, a memory in the past
You think you're big, cause you walk with a shotgun
I got new for you, your days are numbered, son
Why don't you get yourself a job?
When your kid grows up, do you want him to rob?
Look at your mother, teardrops
She just received a phone-call from the cops
""Your son will do life, 'cause he wigged a man's wife
Shot her with a gun and stabbed her with a knife."", or
Take a look at your mother's heart torn
She just received a phone-call from the morgue
""Your son is dead from three shots to the head.
The killer left a note and this is what the note said:
""Never be bigger than you are.
 Never try to pose like you're a superstar
 Next time you rob somebody, and you give him the death-wish.
 When you pull the trigger, nigga, don't miss.""
Is this how you want to be
Dead on the street or locked in a penetentiary?
It's cool to be free
And it's alright for you to be you and for me to be me
Look at you, 15 years old
Coolin on the corner with a can of Old Gold
Whatever happened to school?
Yeah, sure you go to school, but you go to be cool
To sport sneakers that you took from somebody
To talk about the kid that you bucked at some party
Life is a gamble, and you're losin
Before it's too late, brother, you better start choosin
Left from right, right from wrong
Or you'll be singin that old blues song
(Yo, you gotta buck em, or else you're soft)
Some I knew thought the same, now they're way up North
You ain't soft, cause you didn't buck a shot
Put the pistol down, throw up your hands, see what ya got
Old Johnny Walker from around the block
Was livin' rather large 'till he got knocked
He had ""Livin' Large"" on his Jeep plates
""Livin' Large"" on his real estate
He even bought a diamond ""Livin' Large"" name plate
He used to look at cops and smile in their face
Drive a BMW and pump the bass
One day, he made a move for a friend
The f-are-iend, the voice said, ""Yo, I need ten."", Johnny said, ""When?""
Later on that day, Johnny went to play the game he normally plays
To do a favour for a chum
You see, a friend is a friend, but then, some are none
Cause when he got to the spot they were supposed to meet
All he found was a police-infested street
I guess havin a friend is rough
Cause now Johnny's up north, doin push-ups, gettin buffed
You see this chain I've got, I've got it, honestly
You see the clothes I wear, I've got it, honestly
You see the Jeep I drive, I've got it, honestly
I work hard, it ain't easy being me
Never had an excuse for life
Just did what I did, now what I do, I do it right
""Jumbo, Jumbo"", they cry on the block.
5.0, 5.0, lay low, here comes the cops
Man, your lifestyle is petro
On your knees again, because Jumbo said so
""Free Mandela"", you cried
But you still sell dope to brothers and sisters outside
Martin Luther King had a dream (ooh yeah)
That's exactly what turned his dream into a nightmare
Malcolm X said, ""By any means necessary.""
He didn't mean just for you, brother, he meant for everybody
Maybe if we were still slaves, we'll be closer; however
Pickin cotton was bad, but we picked it together
I pray for you, and you pray for me
Sincerely yours, the overweight lover, Heavy D

Repeat chorus to end"
78	Heavy D	"Tic-tac, toe'n, three in a row and privilege
Sit back, relax, listen to a pro and
As I start goin, blowin, flowin, and showin
MCs' that I am the capital H-E-A-V-Y-D-sin
This is my yard, better get my ?preason?
No discontent cause I'm all about pleasin
Ladies come to me because, they love squeezin
If you don't see me, I'm probably skeezin!
Eaaaaaaa-zy desert on the smooth tip
As I get loose, kinda like I say rip this
Format of my rap, listen to direction
Six foot three, wit a manila, complexion
Dance shake, rock, roll
Heav is in the house I got total, control
I'mma inject, respect, collect a fat check
Heav is in effect - but you ain't heard nuttin yet!

How could I explain to ya the Heavmania
Tryna figure eight or make it simple and plain to ya
Hmm, I'm the Heavster, a rap register
That flows with cash so fast you can't measure the
Intent of content that I rep-re-sent
The format of my rap from past to present tense
Girls they adore me, they scream for me
Fellas get jealous cause the ladies won't ignore me
Ov-er-weight Lo-ver MC
H-E-A-V-Y-D, rap champion
Ask Nick and Damian
Joe Black, Pete Rock, Billy Bob and they'll explain to ya
Who is the greatest, the biggest, the baddest! (baddest!)
They won't front, they know the Heavy D. status
My favorite, old time group came Gladys
Knight & The Pips and, love ""Flip"" Wilson
The Great Houdini was my, favorite magician
Sit back relax, 'cause Heav is on a mission
I'mma inject, de-tect, dialect, disect, direct
Heav is in effect - but you ain't heard nuttinyet!

Aiyyo back up, don't even press up, it's time to set up
The staaage, and I won't let up, 'til y'all get up
Or respect whet we inject, so come correct
Heavy D.'s in ef-fect (fect) but you ain't heard nuttin' yet!
Wreaka, no half-stepper, rhyme veteran
Ripper, Moet sipper, 'cause I'm better in
This hand, even that and, a matter of fact
You wanna know the place to be, the place to be is where Heavy's at
I soar without a fall, 'cause I'm courageously standing
I'm in demand, and on the stage I be better
With Eddie F., he's right back at me
The Boyz are to the left and the right, you know we gotta be
Cor-rect as we expect, you too accept our subject
That we direct, to all turtleneck rappers who seem upset
Heavy D.'s in ef-FECT (FECT) - but you ain't heard nuttin' yet!"
79	Heavy D	"Smooth like raindrops, a clock goes tick tock
Nothin' else to do but relax
So I cruise up the avenue, in my new convertible
I see a cutie, my duty is to flirt a little
Get out the car and shake a few hands
Kick some 'sation then expand
to the next territory, got some people waitin' for me
Get to the spot, drop the top, and then we history
Move down to the Apollo, 125th Street
That's where the people of all creeds and colors meet
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me
Easy does it, do it easy

Ca-ca-ca-catch it if you can
'Cause if you don't, you might m-m-m-miss it
The beat is dope, and no note, you can qu-qu-qu-quiz it
The way that I flow, is like an international pro
I'ma let you know, when I go I grow
I flow and blow, to the right tempo
My rhymes are in there, for me it's very simple
I'm the extraordinaire, others they can't compare
to the six foot two half inch light skinned brother with curly hair
An Overweight lovin' machine, the Boyz are my team
My presence is felt, hearts melt like heated ice cream
When I'm through, stand up and clap your hands
But for now, ca-ca-ca-ca-catch it if you can
It's as easy as 1-2-3, A-B-C
And me, I'm the Overweight Lover Heavy D
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me
Easy does it, do it easy

Break it down
Easy does it, do it easy
Easy
Easy does it.. bring it back
Do it easy, easy, easy

I'm laid back, on eight track, and in fact, I'm relaxed
Grab the mic no setbacks
Come on strong like a blizzard, the microphone wizard
Rather exquisite
Sound check, one two one two
Many are called but the chosen are few
And I've been selected, others resurrected
My style, profile, are very well perfected
Move swiftly, stay calm then cool
Lyrics for your spirit that'll make you drool
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me
Easy does it, do it easy"

I am the Overweight Lover MC, Heavy D
This one goes out to my man DJ Eddie F
Trouble T-Roy my partner G-Wiz
This also goes out to my money earnin Mount Vernon crew
J. Daddy, James Huff, Pete Rock, Nick Love
Trak Boogie, and my man Chris Hughley
(You've got a)

A power, because my temper's at the border
Like I said before, I keep a party filled, like a bucket of water
MC, H-E-A-V-Y D
O-V-E-R-W-E-I-G-H-T Lover in the house, on the smooth tip
And I'ma rip this, then I'ma hop hip
Better yet hip-hop, cause you're a drip-drop
Small as a pebble, while Heavy D's a bedrock
I am the capital, H-E-V rappable
King ambassador with more, who's quite a radical
My style's like particular, extra-curricular
Sit back relax, while Heavy D sticks to ya
a new type of tune'n, risin, boomin
When I need a cut I see Scott, for proper groomin
I'ma go on and flow on and turn my microphone on
then blow on to make sure, the sound is strong!
So y'all get up, keep your head up, and then gear up
Heav' is in the funk, the Boyz in the back will fold the rear up
MC's in my path I'ma steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect with more bounce to the ounce

""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce""

Check it now hip hip hooray'n, check what I am sayin
You'll be happy like a faggot in jail, when Heav is playin
No complainin necessary, cause on the contrary
of bein wack I will react, and others I will bury
I'm comin on STRONG while you stutter we're the (?)
Description of my rhyme?  Hmm, butter!
Better yet milky, smooth and silky
Don't applaud you fraud, you wasn't with me
When I started rappin, you wasn't even tappin
Now that I'm done, you pat me on the back
and say what's happenin, I love the rhymes you announce
Heavy D's in effect with more bounce to the ounce

""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More, bounce.. to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce"" 

Check eight seven six five four three two one
Money earnin Mount Vernon, is where I come from
This rap is an article, started from a particle
Hipped up, hyped up, hemmed up, to be historical
An overweight rubbable, squeezably lovable
Ladies come to me and say, ""Heavy you're so huggable""
Not only am I huggable, but I'm quite enjoyable
When I answer the joint you see I'm rather unavoidable
Plus that means attainable, all my niggaz that's got cable
Rope chains, gold chains, the victory explainable
MC's in my path I will steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce""

Place of rest after death? Heaven
Favorite dessert; chocolate chipcake
Favorite dance mine, the Heavy D Shake
Run, my territory, I will say never
The Overweight Lover, is highly, too clever
Extremely intellectual, not bisexual
If this was a basketball game I'd win the sectional
championship, then eat potato chip
with a little onion dip, and then I'll take a trip
to Maui, Maui is a little island a part of Hawaii
I dip upon the plane push up on the stewardess say FLY ME
You never hear another beat quite like this
Done up real smooth with a lyrical twist
MC's in my path I will steadily pounce

Here we go again.. here we go!

Me and the cutie on a, cutie stroll
or, me and my crew on the cutie patrol
It really doesn't matter, as long as I get one
and have some fun before the night is done so I
jet upstairs, make sure they're ready
Call Wiz, T-Roy, Nik Dane Chris and Eddie F
so he can bring his DJ set
And collect respect and jet connect
the two Technics as I get the microphone sound check
Now, throw my Nike's on with my Dapper Dan suit
Drop the top on the Saab, and get ready to troop
Pump up the volume on the Benzi, let the music flow
Throw the car in drive, and I'm ready to go
Pull up in front of the joint, all eyes on the Saab
""Damn he's still livin large!"" Aiyyo, it ain't hard..
.. cause here we go again..

Here we go again.. here we go!
Here we go again.. 

Aiyyo, y'all remember this?
Break it down..

Last chapter, I gotta rap ta
this with a twist and if I miss then I'll have ta
throw a tune on, move on, groove on, soothe on
Go to a jam, and prove I'm smooth on
the microphone the throne I own I stand alone
and carry a tone from here to home so
from beginnin to end, now til then
Heavy D's in the house, so here we go again"

""And I am MC Heavy D..""
""And I am MC Heavy D..""

The Heavster, measure the pleasure then treasure the note
that I wrote, and you can quote, flow like I row like a boat
Takin a stand, don't need a hand
The man in command did Soul Train, next American BAND-stand
An Overweight Lover discover, no other brother can smother
If I ever fell I'd bounce back like rubber
I'm rough and tough, all that stuff, call my bluff
You can't enough of Mr. Big Stuff, let it flow

""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
Let it flow.. let it flow..
""And I am MC Heavy D..""
Let it flow..

You get your rhyme from a hag bag, you thief from Baghdad
You're soft as a sandbag, throw your rhyme in a Glad bag
The way that you act like, as if you had mic fright
It seem that you're not bright, now I'ma do it right
Get used to a back mark, Lover my trademark
You're just like a hush puppy - no bite, all bark
You move when I say so, I flow when the wind blows
While I'm rippin and strippin you be peakin through a window
Definitely for action, voted for Jesse Jackson
Instead of laggin we coulda been passin
Eddie F on the fade mix, the Boyz with the dance tricks
Dre with the management, Heav' D with the lyrics
Who said that I ain't dope, you're walkin a tightrope
You're livin for high hopes, I wonder what you smoke
Didn't come here to tip-toe, I came here to rip so
grab your partner, dosey-dos.. and let it flow

""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
Let it flow.. let it flow..
""And I am MC Heavy D..""
Let it flow.. Eddie F, breakdown!

{""DJ Eddie F""}
Breakdown, break down like this!
{""DJ Eddie F""}

""And I am MC Heavy D..""
""And I am MC Heavy D..""

All rappers we remain the same, we try, we strain
But still some complain about the fame that we obtain
But I'ma refrain it's insane cause I'ma still gain
You want what's good, but can you stand the rain?
We think hard for what we want, then work harder to get it
But you're too busy tryin to diss us, that's why you forget it
Appreciate what you did, and I hope you keep doin it
But stop riffin, because you just might ruin it
For me, for you, for you and for me
Two wrongs never make a right let's keep good company
You're welcome any night to come on my stage
because divided we fall, together we get PAID

""And I am MC Heavy D..""
So, let it flow.. G-Wiz let it flow
""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
T-Roy it flow, Pete Rock let it flow
D.O. let it flow, Nick T let it flow
Eddie F let it flow..

84	Heavy D	"""Ni-Ni-Nike-Nikes""

N-N-N-Nikes I'm for 'em, out the store I bought 'em
And on the b-b-basketball c-court is where I score them
I'm a, Nike bro I sing SOPRANO acapello
Every, tour that I go, oh no, I won't forget 'em
It's a dangerous thing, never leave home without 'em
Trade in my Nikes I won't even think about it
On my beat the Nike's sleeker, the other kicks are weaker
Eddie F pushes the button, the beat comes out the speaker
The boy can do the dancin, he also does romancin
And when I park my Blazer in my Nikes I'll be p-p-prancin'

[Repeat x2]
""Niiiiiiii-kes"" 

Oh what a relief!
They have red ones, yellow ones, black ones too
White on white, green on white, just to name a few
My crew is fully equipped from ah, the tops to bottom
Everything Nike makes, Heavy D & the Boyz got 'em
So hurry up-ah, run to the store, go get a pair
Guaranteed to be the #1 sneaker of the year
If you're buy yourself, get some for your crew
We wear N-Nikes so you should wear N-Nikes too

""The Nike-the Nike-the Nike-the Nike"" [Repeat x4]
""Niiiiiiii-kes"" [Repeat x2]

What else can I say? (Nike)
We didn't do this cause we had to
We did this cause we wanted to
All we wear is Nike, I sleep with Nikes
Ah-aha-ha-ah-ah-ah-Nikes"
85	Heavy D	"Poetically inclined, put in good order
I keep a party filled like a bucket of water
When Heavy's in the house, all the girls go crazy
Fellas that are jealous say, ""Man, you amaze me!""
But all you need is the secret I keep
You grab a girl, gain some weight so she can squeeze the beat
Say ""Hey good lookin"" with the sweetest position
""Get inside the car so I can crank the ignition
You got some trouble, I handle him fo' ya
We cruise around in my BMW""
You got to have the voice to make the people jumpy
I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from three
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin', The Boyz are hop-hippin'
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin'
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin' till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin' all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin' party people performer
Cold gettin' paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide 
From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin'
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin' and rhymin', flyin' and climbin'
To the top where stars are shinin'
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin' is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?) 
I'm chunky but funky

(He's chunky but funky)"
86	Heavy D	"[Chorus]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kinda digging me
But every time you see me
You seem to be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
I'll catch you the next day

When I focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low profile type

I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Chorus]

I'm standing, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
Yeah, and I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A rubber to get got
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from you, girl, sometime
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the boogie down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus]

Hey, yo, hey, yo
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

I never stumble cause I mumble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
It was your trip
Scared a grip
Because I'm losing it
I did what's clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'm-a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus:Repeat x5]"
87	Heavy D	"Is it good to you baby, cause I like it
Is it good to you baby
Cause I like the way you feel

Lay down and relax
Kick off your shoes
I got what you've been waitin' for and more
No more waitin' its time your all mine
So take your time and do 
It right tonight

So if you're ready
And you want it yeah
Come and get it boy
Cause I'm with it
And I won't hold back the 
Feelings I feel
Cause boy its real, so real
So tell me how it feels, baby

Is it good to you baby, cause I like it
Is it good to you baby
Cause I like the way you feel

Oooh, you look so good
Lyin' here
To run my fingers through
Your hair, baby
And if makin' love is your dream
With no other but me
Come and get what you 
Been waitin' for

But take it nice and slow
Don't rush it
Then go round and round
Then push it
Cause I like the way
You feel my body hey
Its feels good baby
So good, but tell me 

Is it good to you baby, cause I like it
Is it good to you baby
Cause I like the way you feel
"
88	Heavy D	"Love somebody

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

I'll search low and I'll search high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
My destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again

They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debating and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
Nothing

It seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?

I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never find
They also say that love is blind

It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me for me

(I know you want love)
Love, that's what I'm talkin' about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for

(Maybe if you take your time)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Yo, Eddie F. break it down

Yeah, aight, here we go
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber

I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
'Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me"
89	Heavy D	"Yo man, you ready to drop this, man? (Yeah-eee)
Well kick it for me one time

(Pass)
(Drop it)

We got our own thang (get up and do my thing)
We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (pass)
We got our own thang
We've got our own thang (drop it)

We got our own thang (get up and do my thing)

(Hey!) everybody, shake your body
We don't ill, we chill at a party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable, the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be alarmed but I'm sewing up the resident
With my particular style-style, particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing up lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-cola with it
Doing very well 'cause I took the right road to this
Path
Maker, undertaker, record breaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'ma end it with a bang (yo)
We got our own thang

We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (get up and do my thing)

(Hey!) picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Meanwhile I'm lampin', feelin' like a champ and
Push up on a cutie, phone digits I'm stampin'
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumpin' in stereo
People said, ""Here we go""
A cutie down in front said
""Heavy, you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
There's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Love is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Flipping on the mic makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, 'cause you couldn't even hang (yo)
We got our own thang

We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)
We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)

He-He-Heavy D
He-He-Heavy D
He-He-Heavy D (get up and do my thing)
He-He-Heavy D
He-He-Heavy D
He-He-Heavy D
Heavy D

Original, individual, smooth criminal
Dance a lot, dance a little
Shuffle to the middle
Don't clock anybody, let 'em all clock you
Don't be down with anybody, let 'em all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought
Started with a pow and I'ma end it with a bang (yo)
We got our own thang

We got our own thang (a diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-dee)

90	Heavy D	"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say cuff
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya' know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha
Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum diddly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So I blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)"
