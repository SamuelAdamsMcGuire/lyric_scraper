0	Circle Jerks	Whatâ€™s Your Problem	"Girls hate guys
because of the things we try
guys hate girls
because of the things they say
behind our backs while we're away

tell me what's your problem?
what's inside of you?
tell me what's your problem?
what you're gonna do?

I got a date
I can't be late
If she don't show up
I'll masturbate"
1	Circle Jerks	Wild in the Streets	"Wild,wild,wild,wild
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets

In the heat of the summer
Better call out a plumber
Turn on the steam pipe
Cool me off
With your big crime fighters
And your newspaper writers
Still need a drugstore
To cure my buzz

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

'64 valiant,hand full of valiums
Couple of beers really do me right
You better believe us,better trust us 
Teenage jive, walking wreck

Wild,wild,wild,running wild
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

Got a gang called the wolves
You have to choose
Play with the boys
You're bound to lose
A bottle in one hand
A can in the other
Don't fool around 'cause they're real
Mean mothers

Wild,wild,wild,wild
Wild running, running
Wild
Mrs. America, how's your favorite son?
Do you care just what he's done?
No

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running

Wild in the streets, we're running, running
Wild in the streets, we're running, running
Wild in the streets, we're running, running

Deny everything, deny everything
I'm being framed, it's all a set-up

5	Circle Jerks	Letter Bomb	"Tired of being bossed around
Getting the run around

Sweep your floors
Empty your trash
You're the one who makes the cash

Tired of being a puissant
9 to 5
Open my letter
You won't be alive

Here's a present just for you
When you'll open it
You'll be through

Sit behind your desk
Act like a king
Treat me like a human being

Give me the worst jobs
I'm getting mad
When you're dead
I'll be glad

Here's a present just for you
When you'll open it
You'll be through

Plastic explosive
On your letter
You'd be better off dead
Hope the building crumbles
On your head
Die! Die!"
6	Circle Jerks	Stars and Stripes	"What they did,past or present
Got us in this situation
Predicament
No where to run
Everybody's building bombs

No more housewives;
""Days of Our Lives"",
Television, Disneyland,
Basketball or stars and stripes

Their chairman's on his death bed
Our president's popularity is down
An epileptic called a colonel
Presses a button
And its all knocked down

No more housewives;
""Days of Our Lives"",
Television, Disneyland,
Basketball or stars and stripes

Hahaha,
You're all gonna die,
And you voted for that guy

Science, modern technology,
Digs your grave
Care of Moscow and DC,
Votes you never gave

No more housewives;
""Days of Our Lives"",
Television,Disneyland,
Basketball or stars and stripes

Or stars and stripes,
Or stars and stripes,
Or stars and stripes

My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty"
7	Circle Jerks	I Don't	"I don't smoke, I don't drink
I don't never have no fun anymore you see
I don't lose any sleep
Worrying about the state of the economy

'Cause the world is turning slowly
But I can't find the time to do anything
If the rest are sharing something
Then I'm just a lonely minority
I don't work I'm a blob
No I can't wake up and I won't

I don't cook I don't clean
I don't have the energy for the scene
And I don't got no car
I don't worry 'bout the price of gasoline

'Cause the world is turning slowly
I can't find the time to do nothing
If the rest are sharing something
I am just a lonely minority
I don't work, I'm a blob 
no I can't wake up and I won't

News is coming on ( I'm watching Three's Company)
I can't get no girls (they don't know how to talk to me)
Get my washing done (been wearing the same clothes for a week) YICH!
Gotta get up early (set the alarm for three)
In the afternoon (you'll find me sitting by the t.v.)
I'm really cool somebody please (turn up the heat)

I don't smoke, I don't drink
I don't never have no fun anymore you see
I don't lose any sleep
Worrying about the state of the economy

'Cause the world is turning slowly
I can't find the time to do nothing
If the rest are sharing something
then I am just a lonely minority
I don't work I'm a blob
No I can't wake up and I won't"
8	Circle Jerks	Back Against the Wall	"You yell out in defiance
You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns and
It makes you feel real small

So you can cuss,
Spit,
Throw bottles
Broken glass
But it all ends up with handcuffs on you hands

You run around and spray paint
Graffiti on everybody's wall
You think that's bitchin' man
That ain't nothing at all!

So you can cuss,spit,throw bottles
Broken glass
But it ends up with a swift kick to your ass"
9	Circle Jerks	Behind the Door	"Mister,give me the key
Point me to the stairs
I don't know what waits for me in

Room 13
Room 13

Dim lit stairway
Stains on the floor
Looking for 13
What's behind the door?

Room 13
Room 13

Prostitutes, hypes and thungs
Meet me on the way
Bare ceilings;just blank
Walls blank walls,

That's okay
Prostitutes,hypes & thugs
Meet me on the way
Empty bottles,spots of blood

That's cool bro,
That's cool,'cause
What waits for me?
A whore,a bullet a thug?

That's okay,
Room 13
That's okay,
Room 13

Turn around
I'll walk away
Turn around
I didn't want to stay there anyway"
10	Circle Jerks	I Just Want Some Skank	"Empty frame on the wall
Cat and mouse when you don't call
All I do is think of her
TV
Screens picture's blurred

So take it away!
Take it away!

Every night the scene is set
I've got to drink to forget
I cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun?
Here's my head!

Let's go to the Hong Kong
Breaking glass at madame Wong's.
Let's go buy a pint of booze
Getting drunk getting loose

[Chorus]
I just want some skank! [Repeat: x4]

Passing flyers at the troub
Seven nights seven 'ludes
What's the deal with this band?
Let's go roll some fields,
Man

[Chorus]

Every night would be so great
I'd take you home to meet mom & dad
And they'll be so glad
They won't think their boy's a fag
Then they'll go upstairs and go to bed"
11	Circle Jerks	Beverly Hills	"Beverly Hills,
Century city
Everything's so nice and pretty
All the people look the same
Don't they know they're so damn lame

There she goes
Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots

I don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Maybe I'll have to move from

Beverly Hills,

Everything's so nice and pretty

Don't they know they're so damn lame

There she goes
Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Fiorucci too
Beverly hills,

12	Circle Jerks	Anxious Boy	"I'm an anxious boy happiness eludes me
In my reach. Poof! then it's gone
Dust my shoulders shaking knees
Scratch this itch that I can't reach
I wanna belong
I wanna be loved; jump up and kiss me

With my tongue planted firmly to the side of mouth
Took some days to sort things out
They're dropping hints of uneasiness
Filled with hostility and hatred

I wanna belong
I wanna be loved
Jump up and kiss me
If you
If you
Kiss me
If you could
If you
If you
Kiss me
If you could

Sand me down I'm feeling rough
Turn me off; I've had enough
I'm a nervous guy pleasure escapes me
In my grasp. Swoosh! then it's gone
Twitching hands sack of bees
Scratch this itch that I can't reach
I wanna belong
I wanna be loved
Jump up and kiss me
If you
If you
Kiss me
If you could

Press these buttons knock it down
I've lost your faith
I need your trust
Far as I'm concerned your name is dust"
13	Circle Jerks	Paid Vacation	"I hope you're having fun
Where's your uniform?
Where's your gun?
Better rub up that suntan oil
Cause you'll be fighting in the desert

It's not, Vietnam
Just another oil company scam

Salute that flag of uncle Sam
Get your money out place your bets
It's Afghanistan!
Fix baionets, check grenades
Got enough bullets
Got enough rounds to wipe out this place?
Were the infantry and cavalry
Parachutes fill the sky, bodies burn and people die"

It'll feed your pride with boredom

I feel it coming on again, just like it did before
They feed your pride with boredom, and they lead you off to war
The way you treat each other, makes me feel ill
And if you want to fight them, then you're dying to get killed

I wanna destroy you

A pox upon the media and everything you read
They'll tell you your opinions and they're very good indeed

Painted myself into a corner
No windows,doors or a ladder

Trapped, I'm trapped

What did I do to deserve this?

But despite his advise
I want an operation
I will not father life

Operation,

They send me to a preacher
A really toughtful guy
He said my idea's crazy

This operation,

But I've just seen a surgeon
And with a knife he cut

A statement of our times
They tied my balls together

23	Circle Jerks	Fortunate Son	"The boys are bored to wave the flag
The red, white and blue
And when the band plays, hail to the chief
To point the cannons right at you
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no sinner's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
'Cause I ain't no fortunate one
Are born, so much burning 
Why don't they help themselves?
And when the tax man comes to the door
The house looks like the running cell
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me 'cause
I ain't no fortunate one
Are born, stars

Go on out
To your favorite liquor store
Go on out
Don't worry about it any more
Go on out

31	Circle Jerks	22	"Glorified neurosis and a carload of explosives
Our doctor friend's just a wee bit fried
Ears to ghetto blasters, a prescription to disaster
An all day job just to stay alive

Would you lick my palms? 
Through moons and stars
Egg laying vertebrates peck green covered yards
Heal my wounds cut straight to my heart
Come on there, chicky gurl, let's blow things apart! 

Honesty and epic shock into corners under rugs
Greasy dishes keep mounting up
(?) Can't be straight forward
Cause you know it's not in their blood

As I try to negotiate my way through this lifetime
I keep getting hung up at all their roadblocks
Would you lick my palms? 
Through moons and stars
Egg laying vertebrates peck green covered yards
Heal my wounds cut straight to my heart
Come on there chicky gurl let's blow things apart! 

As public's slaves to dethroned kings
Transvestite brothers strung out queens
The chosen few most likely succeed
Over there a sucker's born
Mosquito bites and blaring horns
Take his clothes
Kick him out
Then give him the keys

As I try to negotiate my way through this lifetime
I keep getting hung up at all their roadblocks
Would you lick my palms? 
Through moons and stars
While egg laying vertebrates peck green covered yards
Heal my wounds
Cut straight to my heart
Come on there
Gather your stuff
Let's blow things apart!"
32	Circle Jerks	Shining Through the Door	"Never mind how I got all that money
Money doesn't buy me peace of mind
Never mind that I can't find a reason
Reason doesn't ease these troubled times

In this life of degradation
When nothing seems to be worth living for
Truth will come bringing salvation
And that light will come down shining through the door

Every time I try to find a purpose
Purpose seems to turn to disarray
Every time I try to find a meaning
Meaning wants to just slip away

In this life of degradation
When nothing seems to be worth living for
Truth will come bringing salvation
And that light will come down shining through the door
The door... shining through the door
The door... shining through the door

Sometimes it's sad
Sometimes it's funny
We have the power to elevate ourselves
So I guess we have to keep on going
As dust keeps building layers on our shelves
We have the power to elevate ourselves

Never mind how I got all of that money
Money doesn't buy me peace of mind
Never mind that I can't find a reason
Reason doesn't ease these troubled times

In this life of degradation
When nothing seems to be worth living for
Truth will come bringing salvation
And that light will come down shining through the door
Shining through the door
Through the door
Shining through the door
Shining through the door
Shining [x5]
Keep on shining through the door"

Mister wanna buy a watch? Leafy catnip tar some rock
Skid marked asphalt or a pair of dirty socks! 

Everything is up for sale
But never any bargains
On vacation out to lunch
Nervous smokers got the jitters

Coffee stains and shell shocked vets
Child molesting paranoid pimps
Crooked cops and the dog keeps chasing itself
This cycle never stops
Cycle never stops
Cycle never stops. . Helplessness

Street signs read anywhere anytime
Can you stop the bus
This is where I wanna get off
Confronted by trendy chic hipsters
Treading like hamsters
And tires keep turning
Rubber's burning
Attached to motors
No one's learning
Well me hell I'm always looking for
An exit sign
So I can get out
The easy way out
So I can find some peace of brain or a comfortable ride
A cool place to hide
Or a get rich quick scheme
A scapegoat or an excuse without any loopholes
So I won't trip or hang myself

Something ugly settles
As if I'm heavy or short on breath
A feeling of helplessness
A feeling of helplessness
A feeling of helplessness

When I keep hearing their jibberish
Vote no on yes
Don't panic this is only a test
Don't panic this is only a test
Don't panic this is only a test
Don't panic this is only a test

All those unfortunates caught in bad circumstances
Lesbian skinheads who think they're in love
Computer programmers owning nervous disorders
And a few sexual fantasies
Only running on half filled tanks
Half filled tanks
Half filled tanks
Half filled tanks
Who will stand on the deck
On the deck? Of a sinking ship. ..

Highrise hogwash dealt to freeze dried stares
Talk 's expensive listening nobody cares
Cram those bank account's stocks and shares

Now I've got a brick for your window
Now I've got a brick for your window

When individualism dies
Everything's the same
You can kiss my ass to the state machine! 

Good versus evil's such a bogus plot
Things aren't what they seem
I've got a seven and a half for your tv screen! 

Herds of paper eaters licking feet
Static babble now it's starting to tweak
Company kept is just a flock of creeps
Alienate me now I feel like a freak

Dogcatchers clock out, counterfeiters pray
Pilgrims stranded on an asphalt artery
Without black fluid or a power source, caught chicken pox with measles on a breeze 
Some call him history

Purchased printed slips to a nightmare
Hostess strips on a donkey's back
Where every paths unfinished bridges
Now all our rubber's growing flat

We're looking, searching for the witness on a deal where they bartered over aversion
Any descriptions or whereabouts of a character dressed in grey
Spill these words,big payoff! And for his habit, a statue made of hay
Winning draws a reward,humanity gets saved!

Purchased printed slips to a nightmare
Hostess strips on a donkey's back
Every paths unfinished bridges
Now rubber's growing flat

Well timed frauds want to know who's stomping on their toys in their empirical playpen
Where'd they stash the virgins?

To them it doesn't matter, If there's a silver lining
So what's the difference 
If you haven't washed behind your ears?

Shadow length leeches need their cut of the mold as clumsy martyrs fall over potholes
Lining sidewalks to an early grave
Feminist pillhead crosses her legs
With a dozen extra large a a a eggs
Unfolds a map set in her lap to a grimy universe

Lavender and silhouetted horizon
Nut museum's is dining and dashing
Roses growing backwards
As I gaze down at the feeding site!
I'm a helpless romantic, sunk neck deep in quicksand
I'll keep reaching with magnetic eyes"

I'm basically fucked
Could have given everything
But that's not enough
When i asked for sugar
You substitute salt

I'm trying to think up
Some miraculous strategy
To bust loose from this creeping misery

I won't settle for a gray life
I won't settle for a gray life
I won't settle for a gray life

Sawing on my limbs
In this surrealistic dream
Tie me up, gag my mouth
Now i 'm ready to scream
Sad eyed velvet painting
You don't want to be loved
Titanic front row state room
You've been screwing the crew
I might be an imbecile
But i won't be a fool

I'm trying to think up
Some miraculous strategy
To bust loose from this creeping misery

I won't settle on a gray life
I won't settle on a gray life
I won't settle on a gray life

No remorse for those things you did
Hatching schemes beneath those ribs

With the kids they'll say forget it

51	Circle Jerks	Wonderful	"Be nice, say thank you
And please once in a while
It's a beautiful world we live in
So give your brother a smile
Turn to a stranger
And give him a pat on the back
It's not that hard to
Maybe the friendship will last

Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful! (wonderful)
Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful!

Don't smoke, don't litter
Don't step on a beetle or ant
Always walk on the sidewalk
Never tread on the grass
Be kind, be courteous
Open the door for your mom
Help an old person across the street
Give the bum something to eat

Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful! (wonderful)

the plate stays cool, the meat stays warm 
shit just coming on
Read the signs, sound the alarms 

patty's killing me
Senseless murder I can tell 
patty's killing me
red meat, cocktail send him in to hell 

Give the dog a a bone, 
You can tell him not to eat, but is it safe? 
A deadly game, I will repeat 

Susie's killing Sal 
bobby's killing Joe 
its your blood, who's to know? 
Killer killing dale sally' killing Sam 
Get to close you'll understand 

Patty? Yes Mel? 
Is that Doug beneath the counter? 
Does this mean you don't love me anymore? 

Patty's killing Mel 
High rise custom, condo jail 
Patty's killing Mel
hide the keys, raise the bail 
patty's killing Mel 
Right next to the danger zone 
Patty's killing Mel down the block 
Close to your home 

Patty's killing Mel!"
55	Circle Jerks	Casualty Vampire	"The architect of murder gets start billing
Yet another victim another slaying
Silence, flashing lights, police line - do not cross
Blood on the sidewalk, your aunt's on the scene
Hide close to corners 'cause I heard someone say
This poor sucker's, run out of life! 

Casualty vampires, thirsting for blood
Casualty vampires, there's never enough
Casualty vampires sharpen there teeth
Surrounded by the tv, waiting for the last string
Of casualties
Jet crash, news cast, devil's of disaster
How many were lost

Casualty vampires, see nothing but red
Casualty vampires, it's in all of our heads
Stop to watch, stand and stare
Yet another carcass lying there
Earthquake, bomb blast, domestic brawl
What does it matter? To all those who flood

Casualty vampires, drive along the freeway
Casualty vampires, draining their necks
Casualty vampires, pass right by
Causality vampires, look at all the rats"
56	Circle Jerks	Tell Me Why	"Tell me why, tell me why
Why are they always pushing me?
Block my vision so I can't see
Hold me down while they grind on me

Mind your own, just let me be
Go let them in, there are our friends
As long as they play Monopoly
Nothing to hide, set up the scene

Heading a false reality
We need a hype, got a hype
If we believe in what they say
Closer to me, rather behind

It don't seem so far away
Watch your mouth on mindless beach
Be your best, stay on your feet
Cry to so when you weep

Why are they always hounding me?
Why? Tell me why?
Brother's crying, sons are dying
Sounds of weapons, bullets flying

Never giving always taking
Filled with lies, always faking
Never carry, never shake
Always rough and overbearing

Why do you want to fight with me?
Tell me why, tell me why
Sell them tractors, give them seeds
Help them boost their economy

Let them up and hear their pleads
Mind your own, just set them free

It's closer than you know"
57	Circle Jerks	Protection	"Take care beware you need protection
Like the monkey in the jungle don't slip watch the curb
You need protection there's a car coming your name's on it

Like the whales in the ocean, you could be come extinct
Don't let them haunt us
You know what I'm thinking
You better believe all the animals need protection
You need protection

A careless cigarette, slip with the matches 
brush fires burning
Animals on the run who's gonna help them now there's nowhere to go
You need protection
You need protection I need protection too

In a square package some call it prevention
Do you wanna have some fun? You need protection
There's a killer disease running wild it's out to get you

All those people they need protection
Standing still in great masses lead them some shelter
There's a nuclear rain coming soon get your lead umbrella

You need protection I need protection too"
58	Circle Jerks	I'm Alive	"Everyday is such a test
When this world's such a mess
But I'll try hard I'll do my best
Won't get bogged down like all the rest
Got no hamsters in my head 
No monkeys on my back
No chains and shackles to hold me down
I wanna fly I wanna fly

'Cause I'm alive
I'm alive

The world could be such a better place
Who needs that garbage
It's all such a waste
Don't need the drugs
Don't need the booze
Abuse that stuff you'll only loose
A big decision make it right
It's a battle win the fight
Everything's gonna be all right
I wanna fly I wanna fly

I'm alive
I'm alive

Streets and rooms filled with negativity
Filled with gloom all the walking trash
Who the hell wants to live that?
Not me
I'm no screwed up zombie part of the
Living dead
I wanna think have a clear head

Places to go people to meet
Can't do this with your head in the sheets
Tear down all their walls 
Got the world by the balls
Got no hamsters in my head 
No monkeys on my back
No chains and shackles to hold me down
I wanna laugh, I wanna cry

I'm alive"
59	Circle Jerks	Status Clinger	"Everybody out for the money running around
Talk about yourself all the time getting me down
Think about the needs of the many out of sight out of mind
Gotta get ahead turn my back, leave you behind

Point blank take a leap
Pressure play it as it lays
You get to heavy for me
Everyone you meet you bow to their feet

You're a status clinger, nice to meet you
Who do you know, where do you go?
You're a status clinger, now I see you,I can't take it
You're a social climber status clinger
Looking through you, nothing to see
You're a social climber status clinger
I can't take it anymore

Have you seen her, have you seen him, Have you seen them
I don't know
Better think it over, better look out
I gotta go
Escalator, elevator, butt in front of the line
Gotta get ahead, turn my back just a matter of time

Straight up. Take a leap
The buzz is out, its out on the street
Pressure too heavy for me
Everyone I meet seems to agree

Party parasite
Hanging around bothering me
Transparent user
Looking through you, nothing to see
Manipulating loser
What do you have? Whats in it for me?

You're a status clinger, nice to meet you
Who do you know, where do you go?
You're a status clinger, now I see you,I can't take it..

60	Circle Jerks	Living	"Look at all those people
Living in those places
The look of desperation
Written on their faces

No escape no way out
Trapped in a cycle of doubt
Are they happy I don't know
Pockets are empty nothing to show

Living, just living
Hyped out on this
Crapped out on that
I'm tired, give me something
Is that all there is, is that all there is?

Not much hope for any future
No desire to recall the past
Lower standards of education
Hard to think when your stomach is empty

Pro-creation, no conscience, no caution
Another one look what you've done
Soon another mouth to feed
Babies for income, you can't tell me that's

Living, just living
Hyped out on this
Hyped out on that
I'm tired, show me something
Is that all there is, is that all there is?

Walls of many colors
Look at what they're saying
Territorial frustration
There's a war zone inside this nation

A young man stands accused
Street life, nothing new
Filled with anger, filled with hatred
The situation is understated

Living, just living
Hyped out on this
I'm crapped out on that
I'm tired, give me something
Is that all there is, is that all there is?"
61	Circle Jerks	American Way	"I'm living in the USA and I don't care
For the buy it, package it, sell it
Make it shine make it shine

You'll get a bigger piece of the market share
If you wave the American flag
It's the spirit of the dollar not the USA
It's a sign of the times

Don't you get me wrong, it's a
Wonderful place to live
We got freedom we got rights
Friday night fights

I'm living in the USA and I won't swear
On that bible pushing selling
Good old boy good old boy

Try to tell us all
What's good for our children
Put prayer back in the school
Make it right make it right

He can take the food
Right out of your mouth
Its OK your buying salvation
Fly that Lear Jet across the nation

I'm living in the USA and I don't care
Buy it, sell it, commercialize it
On my prime time

Celebrate the reconstruction
Of the statue of liberty
Sell your beer, soft drinks and cars
That's the American way

They can justify anything they do
It's alright, as long as their waving
The red white and blue"
63	Circle Jerks	Love Kills	"Sometimes I ask myself 
why even bother
When it goes in one ear and right out the other
Out on a limb out on the edge no matter what they say
The pleasure of pain day after day, day after day

Love kills
And it hurts me to see you this way
Love kills
And it kills me to treat you this way

Each day we rise with the sun in our room
Needles and pills lead us right to our doom, right to our doom
Looking like the tail end of a hurricane
Death warmed over the rear end of destruction, rear end of destruction

Love kills
And it hurts me to see you this way
Love kills
And it kills me to treat you this way
Love kills
And it hurts me to see you this way
Love kills
And it kills me to treat you this way

Pock marks and scars adorn your face
It used to be pretty
But it's just getting ugly
Cause your getting caught up in a loosing race
You're drowning in a sea of drugs
They pulled out the carpet
Look at everything you've taken
What have you done

The distance grows, you're fading away 
Disturbed since birth
No way to control you
You took a vow to love me forever
Never say you're sorry
I did it my way

Love kills
And it hurts me to see you this way
Love kills
And it kills me to treat you this way"

Get fucked up and pass out on the floor
Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
To your favorite liquor store
Go on out
Don't worry about it any more
Go on out
Get fucked up

Before it blows up

Chewed my fingernails to the bone
Get off my back
Just leave me alone

Wake up tomorrow,do it again
Yes sir, yes ma'am
No sir, no ma'am
Get so fed up
With your fucking scams

Chewed my fingernails to the bone
Get off my back
Just leave me alone

Heavy weight on my mind
Not enough beer
To erase the thought
Work, money, bills, reality,
No spare time no sanity"
82	Circle Jerks	86'd (Good as Gone)	"I read the mail today
They're throwing me out of town
There isn't any way
I get to stick around

They took my stereo
When I turned the volume up
And when I gave them drugs
They couldn't get enough

Turn the tourniquet
'Till I'm sick of it
See the other side
Always overdrawn
Feeling like a pawn
Somebody lied
Somebody lied

I got the news today
They'll tear my apartment down
There isn't any way
I get to stick around

I never thought I'd see
New condos going up
And now I've gotta scream
That I've had enough

Turn the tourniquet
I'm so sick if it
Where's the other side
No more bills to pay
Neighbors gone away
Somebody died
Somebody lied

Turn the tourniquet
I'm so sick of it
Where's the other side
No more bills to pay
Somebody lied."
83	Circle Jerks	Meet the Press	"Caught you in the camera
That's my tool
Saw you take the money
You've been fooled

Not a merchant
Not a disguise
Jury will believe it
When he testifies
Meet the press
All the papers want to know
Why you ever stooped so low
As to take the phony bribe
From the feds

Thank the rice dealer
Dinners at Le 'Parc
You're still good and greedy
But the bills were marked

Forget about the entrapment
No defense
Gonna leave office
When we commence

Save the tears
How you've served and
Been sincere
How you thought it was
A mirror
The high cost of campaigning
Each two years

Meet the press

""Face the Nation"",
You've been had!"

You seem so sincere
Your daughter flips the burgers
As you reach for a second beer

Mom says grace,she's learned her place
The cruelest years are on her face
Two car garage, a master charge
Her tits aren't firm,at least they're large

Murder the disturbed
And all those perturbed
Kill the democrats
Support tuition tax

You served a meal,you spoke with zeal
You think you've still sex appeal
Your daughter serves desert
As you enact your biggest deal

Success has shown a second home
The kids are cute,how they've grown
One is dead,one's on reds
She goes to school,she's too well fed

Murder the disturbed
And all those perturbed
Kill the democrats
Reinstate the draft
Murder the disturbed"

You've got knowledge
A bachelor degree
You read and write

But don't come down on me

You're an educated jerk
Write about us
I could squeeze you
Like a pimple
But I don't need the pus

Defamation innuendo
Defamation innuendo
Communication to third person
It's defamation
My reputation
Defamation, innuendo...

Well,I got the record
I haven't heard it yet
I went to the concert
I wanted to get in on the guest list
But they wouldn't let me in
Defamation innuendo...

I didn't get a change to see the band
Hell,I never heard'em

The story's due tomorrow
What should I write?
Well,they're no good !"

What we can watch and read
I don't need
Some dumb schmuck telling me

Nice communities

Too much stupidity

I don't need
Someone telling me
How to listen and how to read

Whatever happened
To the first amendment
The way these people talk
They've never even heard it"
89	Circle Jerks	Political Stu	"Can you grasp the situation?
Or is it getting out of hand
Riots,killing in the streets
Over the color of a man

Everybody looks the same
With their head stuck in the hand
Every one looks the same
'til you see where they stand

Reactionary politics
Are the order of the day
It makes me really sick to
See the poor,treated this way

Caviar and limousines
High finance and jelly beans
Decorate the east wing California modern,
It' great to be the king

Did you see the demonstrations in another land
Over weapons annihilation care of Uncle Sam

The stock market does not reveal
The arms that they have sold
Half the world can't get a meal
The war is getting cold

A bushel or a barrel
Neither can be saved
You feed your beef with wasted wheat
To dominate your crave

Can you hear the foreign voices
Can you understand?
Every great civilization crumbles in the sand
Organizations and their plans
I'm anti SWA, anti Klan
P.L.O., J.D.L., they can all burn in hell"
93	Circle Jerks	Firebaugh	"Brown and white, enter the night
Opposite sides of the street
No one speaks, no one looks
Their paths shall never meet
An unsuspecting traveler
Stranded in the night

Trapped in a realm of existence
Everybody's right
A voice cries out ""Hey Charlie Brown""
Are you the next Vato who's gonna go down?
Heads turn, we told you so
If your car breaks down
Don't take a tow to

[Chorus]
Firebaugh, Firebaugh
A place where no one dreams
Where either race is human waste
It's here that silence screams
Firebaugh, Firebaugh
The outer limits near
Drinking beer's the pastime here
This place is filled with hate and fear

Cornfields die, custard things
See the boredom in their eyes
Low riders, okies look for romance
Is this the place where the blackbirds dance?
Three men one woman sit at the bar
She's the town whore, the village star
Who'll be the one to get up her dress?
Pass on by avoid this mess

[Chorus]

If by chance your car breaks down
Keep your ear close to the ground
You might end up on the wrong side of town
What can you do? They're plotting your mouth"
95	Circle Jerks	Karma Stew	"Do you feel strange?
Walking down the street
This might be your unfortunate day
Not proud of your past
You burned a few
Now you're cooking
In your own stew

Our lives are based on time
You've got to feel your way through
It might come back to you
And when it does you'll understand

Is there something wrong?
Karma stew
Is there something wrong?
Karma stew

All your plans they will fall through
'Cause you told lies and never truths

Our lives are based on time
You've got to feel your way through
It might come back to you
And when it does you'll understand
Something is wrong"

There's a lesson to be learned

15 minutes of fun, pleasure
Now you're gonna go insane

Really sucks, I can't trust you

Losers here are so uncool
Brought me here, took my cash, get away
Take me for a fool

[Chorus]
Rock house is destroying you
Low life's smoking cools
locked door are the rule
Ramdoors breaking through

Zombie girls drooping eyes
Can't get enough, one more puff
We're not through

Legs are spread, mouths are open
Most of them are hoping that it might be you
Spent the cash, make a dash
Keep inhaling till your face is turning blue

All the lies and alibis

happiness together, honey, there's just no way
Our love has seen much better days
It's over now

You put me down
You brushed me off
Stepped on, pushed and shoved
I'll show you
I've had enough

102	Circle Jerks	Golden Shower of Hits [Jerks on 45]	"Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend the time to find a person who's so
Close to me

And then along comes Mary (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And then she want to give me kicks and
Now what to get from me will be memories
I really got the tales, all the trials and tribulations
No one's ever seen

Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the skies
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

From the day that you were born the fairies got together and decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled angel dust in your hair
Golden starlight in your eyes, ooh

I find my baby, gotta hold her tight
Gotta grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been ""when it's right, it's right""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

(Thinking of you's working up my appetite)
(Looking forward to a little afternoon delight)
(Rubbing sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite)
(And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting)
(Sky rockets in flight)
(Afternoon delight!)
(Afternoon delight!)

Have my baby
What a wonderful way of saying how much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying what you're thinkin' of me
I can see it
Faces glowing
I can see it in your eyes, a happy knowing
'Cause you're having my baby
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doing to ya
Having my baby!
You're a woman in love and I love what's going through ya

Love, love will keep us together
Think of me babe, whenever
Some sweet-talking guy comes along
Singin' a song
Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong
Stop (stop!) I really love you
Stop (stop!) I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're holding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Becomes final today
Me and little S-O-B
Will be going away
But I love you both, and this will be pure H-E-double-L on me
How I wish we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E

Until I'm proven guilty
Deny everything,
Deny everything
I'm being framed
It's all a set-up
Deny everything,
Deny everything

I'm just a spook in the wheel
Just a part of the puzzle
A part of the game
I'm being framed

Innocent

Deny everything

Cat and mouse when you don't call
All I do is think of her
TV
Screens picture's blurred

So take it away!
Take it away!

Every night the scene is set
I've got to drink to forget
I cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun?
Here's my head!

Let's go to the Hong Kong
Breaking glass at madame Wong's.
Let's go buy a pint of booze
Getting drunk getting loose

[Chorus]
I just want some skank! [Repeat: x4]

Passing flyers at the troub
Seven nights seven 'ludes
What's the deal with this band?
Let's go roll some fields,
Man

[Chorus]

Every night would be so great
I'd take you home to meet mom & dad
And they'll be so glad
They won't think their boy's a fag
Then they'll go upstairs and go to bed"

There she goes
Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots

I don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Maybe I'll have to move from

Beverly Hills,
Century city
Everything's so nice and pretty
All the people look the same
Don't they know they're so damn lame

Spandex pants
Fiorucci too

But despite his advise
I want an operation
I will not father life

Operation,
Operation

They send me to a preacher
A really toughtful guy
He said my idea's crazy
I shouldn't even try

This operation,
Operation
Snip & tie,
Snip & tie

But I've just seen a surgeon
And with a knife he cut
I cannot bring you children
This world is such a rut

A statement of our times
They tied my balls together
What's insides not alive"

You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns and
It makes you feel real small

So you can cuss,
Spit,
Throw bottles
Broken glass
But it all ends up with handcuffs on you hands

You run around and spray paint
Graffiti on everybody's wall
You think that's bitchin' man
That ain't nothing at all!

So you can cuss,spit,throw bottles
Broken glass
But it ends up with a swift kick to your ass"

I was so heavy man
I lived on the strand

I was so fucked up
I was so screwed up
I was so jacked up

Rip 'em up,
Tear them down

You know I've got the world up my ass"

Just another oil company scam

Salute that flag of uncle Sam
Get your money out place your bets

Were the infantry and cavalry
Parachutes fill the sky, bodies burn and people die"
