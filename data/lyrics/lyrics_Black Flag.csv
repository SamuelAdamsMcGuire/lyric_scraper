Rise above, we're gonna rise above
They distort what we say
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Try and stop what we do
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
When they can't do it themselves
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

Society's arms of control
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Laugh at us behind our backs
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
I find satisfaction in what they lack
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, but it's no use

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, but it's no use

We're born with a chance
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
I am gonna have my chance 
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
We are born with a chance
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
And I am gonna have my chance 
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

1	Black Flag	"Thirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink til you cant
Even see any more

Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more

My brother wants a ride
To the liquor store
You pity him
For what he wants it for

Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more

It's 1:30
And were all getting nervous
The store closes at two
There's not enough to last us

Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more"
2	Black Flag	"I'm about
To have a nervous breakdown
My head really hurts
If I don't find a way out of here

I'm gonna go berserk 'cause
I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
It's going berserk I hear the same old talk talk talk

The same old lines
Don't do me that today,
yeah If you know what's good for you
You'll get out of my way

'Cause I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
Going berserk
I won't apologize

For acting outta line
You see the way I am
You leave any time you can cause
I'm crazy and I'm hurt

Head on my shoulders
Going berserk
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
I don't care what you fuckin' do

I don't care what you fuckin' say
I'm so sick of everything
I just want to die!"

TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight!

We're gonna have a TV party tonight
All right!
We're gonna have a TV party, all right
Tonight!

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight
All right!
We'll pass out on the couch, all right
Tonight!

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

That's incredible!
Hill Street Blues!
Dallas!
Fridays!

We sit glued to the TV set all night
And every night
Why go into the outside world at all
It's such a fright

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

TV news shows
What it's like out there
It's a scare
You can go out if you want
We wouldn't dare

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

Saturday Night Live!
Monday Night Football!
Jeffersons!
Vegas!

I wouldn't be without my TV for a day
Or even a minute
Don't even bother to use my brain any more
There's nothing left in it

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Hey, wait a minute, my TV doesn't work!
It's broken!
What are we gonna do tonight, this isn't fair!
We're hurtin'

We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV just a couple of brews

What are we gonna talk about?
I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows!

No That's Incredible!
No Monday Night Football!
No Jeffersons!
No Friday!

No TV party tonight!"

Standing here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do but 
Shoot my mouth off

Gimme gimme gimme
Gimme some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for

I'm gonna go out
Get something for my head
If I keep on doing this, I'm gonna end up dead

So, gimme gimme gimme
Gimme some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for

I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can be solved with an atom bomb

So, gimme gimme gimme

Its my turn to be jealous, now I don't stand for it all
In fact I'm pretty stupid, I'm feeling small

I was lying just to save my skin pushing on the accelerator how am I gonna tell her I'm into love and passion ...action driving you ride shotgun trying to find us some fun break the rules from under the gun kissing ass isn't my idea of fun driving but I'm really driven confined to the rules I've been given How can I find my course When I see my problems and society is the source No It's crazy but it's true when... nothing can stop you just got to do what you've got to do Music fantasies of lies selling up high in the sky but all we want to do is get down there's got to be a turnaround television selling... from the lost souls consuming what they're told taking their money leaving them cold minds dead before they're old thinking of the heartaches the love I missed all the pain it started with a kiss how much longer can I wait How much longer can I put up with this? Society's tease Is society's disease but all the girls locked up is not what we need Society's tease Is society's disease but all of us locked up is not what we need driving right into a ditch another hole, another bitch feeling like I want to kill or kiss but I don't know which ...another woman another whore you're hooked, you want more driving to the candy store but always asking ""what for"" always wherever I go Playing some stupid role sometimes I look at the world and I just want to say, ""noooo!"" Somewhere something went wrong where love plays stupid tricks where good and evil mix but I've got a plan the world will finally be saved...

49	Black Flag	Beat my head against the wall one more time Will this solve my problems at all? I don't care about parties or a good time I won't stand in your line Swimming in the main stream is such a lame dream No method to the madness Beat my head against the wall Tension builds up so quickly My judgement becomes affected And without my even knowing it I have started to act like a dick Swimming in the main stream is such a lame dream No method to the madness Beat my head against the wall Running around like a chicken without a head Get my kicks bouncing around in bed But the next day I still feel the same I'll find a way yo Blast again Swimming in the main stream is such a lame dream No method to the madness Beat my head against the wall

We sit glued to the TV set all night
And every night
Why go into the outside world at all
It's such a fright

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

TV news shows
What it's like out there
It's a scare
You can go out if you want
We wouldn't dare

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

Saturday Night Live!
Monday Night Football!
Jeffersons!
Vegas!

I wouldn't be without my TV for a day
Or even a minute
Don't even bother to use my brain any more
There's nothing left in it

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Hey, wait a minute, my TV doesn't work!
It's broken!
What are we gonna do tonight, this isn't fair!
We're hurtin'

We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV just a couple of brews

What are we gonna talk about?
I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows!

No That's Incredible!
No Monday Night Football!
No Jeffersons!
No Friday!

Til the devil's in your backyard
But she can't quite forget
That night in my corvette
Annihilating the week
Sledge hammers to the street
But then on Sunday
You're looking mighty weak

She thinks she's feeling better
But her conscience won't let her
Your thoughts temporarily deceived
But your virginity can't be retreived
You never had it before
And now you can't close the door

Bountiful wonderland of lost souls staggering around arms out stretched looking?
For something??.lonely hero man sitting on the crest of the apocalypse 
And our boy says something like uhhhh?..

Listen, everything's nice
Well, it's nice and cool here where I am
It's nice and tight
It's my mind
It's my mind where it's all dark
And no one comes in
Nobody comes in
Damaged
My damage
No one comes in
Stay out!"
201	Black Flag	"My name's Henry
And you're here with me now
My life
It's a song, ah
You're just, you won't even let it happen
You won't
You won't let
Damaged, by attack
I'm even attacking my mind
But you don't mind
'Cause this schedule thirteen
You just sit, down
Buy their ticket
Wait your turn

Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, can't feel another day
Can't, can't get past you
I can't see nothin', I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
Hold out your hand to me
Give me your hand
Aah, I'll bite it off!!

Damaged!
Damaged!
Damaged!

Oh
I, I don't even care about self-destruction anymore
What's the use?
I just sit at home alone
Cold fingers, gold fingers, in a cold sweat
And then I remember
I remember a day
We'd go for a ride in the country
And you'd say
Sing it boy!
Do it again
Do it again
Yes sir!
Yes sir!
Yes sir, yes sir oh yes sir yes sir yes, aah
Aah

Right, now, look at me, now
Look at me now
Just shadows
I'm just shadows of what I was
I just want another day
I don't even get by for that
How much is it to ask for, how, how, aah?

Damaged
Ooh, aah

Ah, I'm sorry, my friend, I just, I just can't
Listen, everything's nice
Well, it's nice and cool here where I am
It's nice and tight
It's my mind
It's my mind where it's all dark
And no one comes in
Nobody comes in
Damaged
My damage
No one comes in
Stay out!"

And nothing to do!
I've got a six-pack
And I don't need you

Thrity-five dollards and a six pack to my name (six-pack!) 
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame? (six-pack!) 
They say I'm fucked up all the time (six-pack!) 
""Well, the dude's a waste of time"" (six-pack!) 

I know it'll be okay
I get a six pack in me, all right 
My girlfriend asked me which one do I like better? (sixpack!)
I hope the answer don't upset her (six-pack!)
I was born with a bottle in my mouth (six-pack!) 
Now I've got six so I'll never run out (six-pack!) 

I know it'll be okay
When I get a six pack in me, well, all right!

Aah, thrity-five dollars and a six pack to my name six pack!

The same old lines
Don't do me that today,

You'll get out of my way

'Cause I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
Going berserk

For acting outta line

You leave any time you can cause

Rise above, we're gonna rise above
They distort what we say

Rise above, we're gonna rise above

We are tired of your abuse

Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Laugh at us behind our backs
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
I find satisfaction in what they lack
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

Try to stop us, but it's no use

We are tired of your abuse

I am gonna have my chance
