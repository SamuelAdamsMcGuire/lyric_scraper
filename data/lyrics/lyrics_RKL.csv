0	RKL	Beautiful Feeling	"Can you see, can you see?
The colors on your wall,
Reality's much different now,
The answers at your call.
Like a tiny infant,
Care with every step.

Moving through this fantasy,
Now gamble, place your bets.
Don't stop this trip,
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip,
'Cause I don't wanna grip.

Brain is frying hard now,
Hallucinations wild.
Curiosity's growing,
Like a feeble child.

You think you know about what I am,
You can say I'm just like them
My brain is burning, can't you see?
We're all Rich Kids On L-S-D
Don't stop this trip.

'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip.
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip.
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip.
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Rich Kids On L-S-D!"
1	RKL	Chinese Rocks	"Somebody calls me on the phone.
Say hey-hey-hey is Arty Home.
You wanna take a walk.
You wanna go cop.
You wanna go get some Chinese Rock.
I'm livin' on a Chinese Rock.
All my best things are in hock.
I'm livin' on a chinese rock.
Everything is in the pawn shop.
The plaste fallin' off the wall.
My girlfriend cryin' in the shower stall.
It's hot as a bitch.
I should've been rich.
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese ditch."
2	RKL	Pothead	"

Smoke a doob to my forehead.
It's in my mouth before I leave my bed.
Can't you see?
I gotta get stoned.
'Cause I'm just another Pothead.
Without a doob I'm totally lost.
Gotta score some bud,
Whatever the cost.
Sell me a bowl, or maybe a jib,
Or I can't even live.
It just gets worse day by day.
Have to smoke more to get the same way.
Eyes turn red, cough up lung cheese.
Gotta be ganj, never no leaf.
Without a doob I'm totally lost.
Gotta score some bud,
Whatever the cost.
Sell me a bowl, or maybe a jib,
Or I can't even live.
Pothead!
Pothead!
Pothead!
Pothead!
Pothead!
Without a doob I'm totally lost.
Gotta score some bud,
Whatever the cost.
Sell me a bowl, or maybe a jib,
Or I can't even live.

3	RKL	Why?	"They seem to be in a state identical to that curious 20th century earth disease called hard drug abuse.

I had to get high,
Didn't matter how at the time.
Dirty needles,
Gave me a disease.
Yellow eyes, yellow skin,
My liver bleeds!
But I don't need it anymore,
And why I ever did before?
Why? Why?
All my insecurities.
An escape that led to this disease.
Addiction is something I don't need!
I had to get high,
Didn't matter how at the time.
Dirty needles,
Gave me a disease.
Yellow eyes, yellow skin,
My liver bleeds!
But I don't need it anymore,
And why I ever did before?
Why? Why?
All my insecurities.
An escape that led to this disease.
Addiction is something I don't need!
But I don't need it anymore,
And why I ever did before?
Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
All my insecurities.
An escape that led to this disease.
Addiction is something I don't need!
As a Vulcan, I find the need for hard drugs to be totally illogical"
4	RKL	Lies	"Hey yeah! Jon told me to.
Hey, Thanks to all the people who have seen us more than once.
This is our last German ???.
Oh yeah. The rumour. It's a lie. Go.
(Joe)This is your live record so show 'em how Berlin can rock.
Ah, that's wonderful. TV and media, it's all a cover up.
They won't accept the blame,
Because they fucked up!
Moscow makes a mistake,
And then it's our fault
Just tell me who I should believe.
Corn flake cereals, MTV videos,
All our minds are turning into waste.
T.V. News says it's the truth,
But it's just a big lie, it's a lie!
Plant their Lies inside my brain,
Just like a big seed.
Another capitalist game,
And on you they feed.
Corn flake cereals, MTV videos,
All our minds are turning into waste.
Trained like an animal,
Like a slave, I must obey.
Obey the Lies.
Obey the Lies!
Corn flake cereals, MTV videos,
All our minds are turning into waste.
T.V. News says it's the truth,
But it's just a big lie,
Just a lie!"
