0	A Flock of Seagulls	"I walk along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day"
1	A Flock of Seagulls	"She's an automatic
He's a cosmic man
They will get together
They should know better by now

The meet in a garden
Down in old japan
Where young love's forbidden
You've got to keep it hidden

Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic

Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic

They locked him away
For twenty years they say
You won't see him again
But I know diff'rent

Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic
Modern love is
Automatic
Automatic
Automatic
Automatic
Automatic
Automatic
Automatic"

3	A Flock of Seagulls	"I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And they touched my mind
Although it took a while
I was falling in love
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes)
And you made me cry (and you made me cry, and you made me cry)
And for a little while (a little while, a little while)
I was falling in love

I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love"
4	A Flock of Seagulls	"It's not the way you look
It's not the way that you smile 
Although there's something to them
It's not the way you have your hair
It's not that certain smile
It could be that with you

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the make up and
It's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do
It must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long
Tell me is it all for nothing
Just don't walk out the door

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing"
5	A Flock of Seagulls	"You keep stopping when you could be walking
Looking at the pictures on the wall
You keep quiet when you should be talking
You just don't make any sense at all
 
Remember when you were much younger
And you were lying in your bed
Among the satin sheets and pillows
Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?
Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama?"

7	A Flock of Seagulls	"I've got information
'something you should hear
Electrical motion
Is in the atmosphere

Something in the air has
Given me a scare
Electric in my fingers
Electric in my hair

Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where

Thinking of the future
Living in the past
Electric interference
Disturbance from the blast

Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where

Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where"
8	A Flock of Seagulls	"Hold on hold on

I'm trying to transfer affection
Trying to feel factor four
Trying to change my direction
To go where I was once before

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm trying to break all connections
Burning a hole in my heart
Trying to transfer affection
Is starting to tear me apart

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm tired but then on reflection
It's so hard to open my eyes
To try reaching out for affection
It's so hard to break the disguise

Hold on hold on"
9	A Flock of Seagulls	"You never give your heart to a stranger
Or tell your secrets to a friend
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
They all desert you in the end

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

They say that nothing lasts forever
And even true love turns to pain
Don't trust your feelings to a stranger
Don't want to go through this again

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

Don't never give your heart to a stranger
Don't ever think that you can go on
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
Turn around and love is gone

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away"
10	A Flock of Seagulls	"Man made machines make music for the man
Now machines make music while the man makes plans
A second generation a generation lost
While the man prepares for the holocaust

Man made machines to control the days
Now machines control while the man obeys
A second generation a generation lost
While machines prepare for the holocaust"

12	A Flock of Seagulls	"I walk along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama?"

I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran

I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the evening sky

Aurora Borealis comes in view

I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I couldn't get away"
91	A Flock of Seagulls	"I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And they touched my mind
Although it took a while
I was falling in love
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes)
And you made me cry (and you made me cry, and you made me cry)
And for a little while (a little while, a little while)
I was falling in love

I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love"
92	A Flock of Seagulls	"It's not the way you look
It's not the way that you smile 
Although there's something to them
It's not the way you have your hair
It's not that certain smile
It could be that with you

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the make up and
It's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do
It must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long
Tell me is it all for nothing
Just don't walk out the door

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing"
93	A Flock of Seagulls	"You never give your heart to a stranger
Or tell your secrets to a friend
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
They all desert you in the end

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

They say that nothing lasts forever
And even true love turns to pain
Don't trust your feelings to a stranger
Don't want to go through this again

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

Don't never give your heart to a stranger
Don't ever think that you can go on
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
Turn around and love is gone

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love

95	A Flock of Seagulls	"You keep stopping when you could be walking
Looking at the pictures on the wall
You keep quiet when you should be talking
You just don't make any sense at all
 
Remember when you were much younger
And you were lying in your bed
Among the satin sheets and pillows
Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?
Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?

96	A Flock of Seagulls	"Hold on hold on

I'm trying to transfer affection
Trying to feel factor four
Trying to change my direction
To go where I was once before

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm trying to break all connections
Burning a hole in my heart
Trying to transfer affection
Is starting to tear me apart

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm tired but then on reflection
It's so hard to open my eyes
To try reaching out for affection
It's so hard to break the disguise

Hold on hold on"
97	A Flock of Seagulls	"I hear voices but there's no one there,
You speak to me in another language.
Computer says it's a binary code,
It's such a pity I can't understand it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

I see a ship from a golden sky,
I sent a message. Will they understand it?
Computer's ready but to overload,
This isn't happening the way I planned it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.
(sending messages)

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

I made a contact with another world,
Another being from another planet.
Another time and another place,
Another galaxy, another planet.

The way he used to hypnotize his young
Remember David's words
The words he said to us when we were small

Remember David's hair
The way his long hair fell across his brow
Remember David's smile
I wonder where he's gone to now?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's asking questions
Tell me David, what's the secret?
Tell me David, what's the answer?

Remember David's eyes
The gray-green eyes he hides his world behind
And all the things he saw,
He saw for us when we were blind

Remember David's smile
The spirit moves tonight to make you shine
Remember David's words
The words he said would last all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, do you have the answer?
Do you have the answer?

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The day that David died
The world stood still
The stars refused to shine
And now he's far away from love
That was his only crime

The spirit moves tonight
To make your young heart
Make your young heart shine
The words he said to us
I'll carry with me for all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the question?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?

Down in old japan
Where young love's forbidden

They locked him away
For twenty years they say

The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

I just ran
I ran all night and day

Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view

 A trace was left by your perfume
 The only thing you couldn't take
 Are the golden memories of you
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls
 Across an ocean wide a voice that calls your name
 A love that never dies like an eternal flame
 Across the great divide for all eternity
 Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine
 Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
 But now the sun shines high above
 And I won't miss you anymore
 Cause I've found another love
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls"

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day"
122	A Flock of Seagulls	"I walk along the avenue.
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you.
Meet a girl like you.

With auburn hair and tawny eyes.
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through.
Hypnotize me through.

[Chorus]
And I ran.
I ran so far away.
I just ran.
I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away.

A cloud appears above your head.
A beam of light comes shining down on you.
Shining down on you.

The cloud is moving nearer still.
Aurora borealis comes in view.
Aurora comes in view.

[Chorus]

Reached out a hand to touch your face.
You're slowly disappearing from my view.
... pearing from my view.

Reached out a hand to try again.
I'm floating in a beam of light with you.
Beam of light with you.

Or tell your secrets to a friend
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
They all desert you in the end

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

They say that nothing lasts forever
And even true love turns to pain
Don't trust your feelings to a stranger
Don't want to go through this again

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

Don't never give your heart to a stranger
Don't ever think that you can go on
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
Turn around and love is gone

Looking at the pictures on the wall
You keep quiet when you should be talking
You just don't make any sense at all
 
Remember when you were much younger
And you were lying in your bed
Among the satin sheets and pillows
Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?
Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?

 Like crystal teardrops to the floor
 It's even raining in my heart
 I'll close my eyes and let it pour
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls
 And in the darkness of the night
 A trace was left by your perfume
 The only thing you couldn't take
 Are the golden memories of you
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls
 Across an ocean wide a voice that calls your name
 A love that never dies like an eternal flame
 Across the great divide for all eternity
 Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine
 Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
 But now the sun shines high above
 And I won't miss you anymore
 Cause I've found another love
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls"

You keep quiet when you should be talking
You just don't make any sense at all
 
Remember when you were much younger
And you were lying in your bed
Among the satin sheets and pillows
Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?
Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?

Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?

Do you love me?

Trying to feel factor four
Trying to change my direction
To go where I was once before

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm trying to break all connections
Burning a hole in my heart
Trying to transfer affection
Is starting to tear me apart

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide

To try reaching out for affection
It's so hard to break the disguise

Remember David's hair

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's asking questions
Tell me David, what's the secret?
Tell me David, what's the answer?

Remember David's eyes
The gray-green eyes he hides his world behind
And all the things he saw,
He saw for us when we were blind

Remember David's smile
The spirit moves tonight to make you shine
Remember David's words
The words he said would last all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, do you have the answer?
Do you have the answer?

Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The day that David died
The world stood still
The stars refused to shine
And now he's far away from love
That was his only crime

The spirit moves tonight
To make your young heart
Make your young heart shine
The words he said to us
I'll carry with me for all time

He said the world keeps on turning

Tell me, David, what's the question?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do
It must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long
Tell me is it all for nothing
Just don't walk out the door

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing"

Lost in the glow of the neon lights

Feeling the rhythm, feeling the heat
No one can see all the tears I cried
Dancing alone, lost to the beat

My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again for the dancer
I am the dancer
I'm the dancer
I am the dancer

Dancing alone here in this crowded room
Millions of faces, but no one I see
Dancing alone, the shadows call too soon
My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

I'm just a dancer, wo oh, wo oh oh
I'm just a dancer who needs more, wo oh
I'm dancing in and out of time
You keep me waiting on the line, wo oh

Over my head

Over my head
I think I'm in

I think I'm in

Another starving baby's cry
A dying heart that's still made bold
Another coke another lie
A naked man I stand alone
Searching for the easy answer
Searching for a love that has no pain
Under the circumstances
The walls of love caved in again
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head

 Are the golden memories of you

 A love that never dies like an eternal flame
 Across the great divide for all eternity
 Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine

 And I won't miss you anymore
 Cause I've found another love

Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

Looking at the pictures on the wall
You keep quiet when you should be talking
You just don't make any sense at all
 
Remember when you were much younger
And you were lying in your bed
Among the satin sheets and pillows
Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?
Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?

Or tell your secrets to a friend
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
They all desert you in the end

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

They say that nothing lasts forever
And even true love turns to pain
Don't trust your feelings to a stranger
Don't want to go through this again

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you throw away

Don't never give your heart to a stranger
Don't ever think that you can go on
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
Turn around and love is gone

Down in old japan
Where young love's forbidden
You've got to keep it hidden

They locked him away
For twenty years they say

Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

What happened to the wings that used to search the sky?
Where did the clouds all fly?
No sign of life around me, nothing anywhere.
This moment I should share.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

But I'm so glad I waited,
As I anticipated,
'Cause now I see you.

I see your points of silver piercing the night,
Moving towards my sight.
I'll never understand the lights up in the sky
No matter how I try.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

I never thought I'd meet a girl like you.

I ran so far away.
I just ran.
I ran all night and day.

A cloud appears above your head.
A beam of light comes shining down on you.
Shining down on you.

The cloud is moving nearer still.
Aurora Borealis comes in view.
Aurora comes in view.

Reached out a hand to touch your face.
You're slowly disappearing from my view.
Disappearing from my view.

Reached out a hand to try again.
I'm floating in a beam of light with you.

 A love that never dies like an eternal flame
 Across the great divide for all eternity
 Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine

Would the innocent still die

I just want to raise my family
I'm just an ordinary man
Are you blinded by what you see on the TV screen
To the devils and their plans
Does the blood of a dying man
Or a starving child wash right off your hands

I'm doing everything I can
I just want to raise my family
Yes I'm just an ordinary guy
And I'm not reaching for the sky

The way he used to hypnotize his young
Remember David's words
The words he said to us when we were small

Remember David's hair
The way his long hair fell across his brow
Remember David's smile
I wonder where he's gone to now?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's asking questions
Tell me David, what's the secret?
Tell me David, what's the answer?

Remember David's eyes
The gray-green eyes he hides his world behind
And all the things he saw,
He saw for us when we were blind

Remember David's smile
The spirit moves tonight to make you shine
Remember David's words
The words he said would last all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, do you have the answer?
Do you have the answer?

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The day that David died
The world stood still
The stars refused to shine
And now he's far away from love
That was his only crime

The spirit moves tonight
To make your young heart
Make your young heart shine
The words he said to us
I'll carry with me for all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the question?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
The world keeps on turning
The world keeps on turning
The world keeps on turning?"

No sign of life around me, nothing anywhere.
This moment I should share.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

I see your points of silver piercing the night,
Moving towards my sight.
I'll never understand the lights up in the sky
No matter how I try.

I just ran
I ran all night and day

A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you

What happened to the sun?
What happened to the buildings and the fields and trees?
Won't someone tell me, please?

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

What happened to the wings that used to search the sky?
Where did the clouds all fly?
No sign of life around me, nothing anywhere.
This moment I should share.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

But I'm so glad I waited,
As I anticipated,
'Cause now I see you.

I see your points of silver piercing the night,
Moving towards my sight.
I'll never understand the lights up in the sky
No matter how I try.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

He gets his pencils and he makes a note
And I'm committed
There's a hole in the wall
Committed

And I'm bustling it all
Committed
Like a hole in your head 
Committed

Makes me wish I was dead
Committed
Committed
Committed

Committed

 You're in the end of your time
 No future no past
 No reason no rhyme
 All you friends will arise
 So you have nothing to tell
 And you think your desires
 So may happen
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel
 You got your head in the clouds
 Yes you're walking on it
 You can forget all your worries
 Get all your things
 Touch the wings of an angel
 Everything becomes clear
 Touch the heart and discover
 When you're living up here
 Living in Heaven 
 You're living in Heaven
 You're living in Heaven
 You're living in Heaven
 So how does it feel
 When you find all your dreams
 In the twilight's blackness
 Speak to you as they will
 With just one look in your eyes
 With just a touch of your hands
 All the walls they will come down
 Turning your wails into sand
 Living in Heaven
 You're living in Heaven
 You're living in Heaven
 You're living in Heaven

Searching for a love that has no pain

We were walking in the rain
It only seems that our own soul
Since I looked into your soul
Is tearing me apart
To tell the story of the young heart
The story of the young heart
It only seems that we got to say
Maybe it's been near two years
Since we were burning down the days
Neither happiness nor tears
The story in your eyes
Is the story of the young heart

I hear the shadows calling my name
Lost in the glow of the neon lights
My heart is calling

Never again

Feeling the rhythm, feeling the heat
No one can see all the tears I cried
Dancing alone, lost to the beat

My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again for the dancer
I am the dancer
I'm the dancer
I am the dancer

Dancing alone here in this crowded room
Millions of faces, but no one I see
Dancing alone, the shadows call too soon
My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

I'm just a dancer, wo oh, wo oh oh
I'm just a dancer who needs more, wo oh
I'm dancing in and out of time
You keep me waiting on the line, wo oh
I am the dancer

Never again

The way he used to hypnotize his young
Remember David's words
The words he said to us when we were small

Remember David's hair
The way his long hair fell across his brow
Remember David's smile
I wonder where he's gone to now?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's asking questions
Tell me David, what's the secret?
Tell me David, what's the answer?

Remember David's eyes
The gray-green eyes he hides his world behind
And all the things he saw,
He saw for us when we were blind

Remember David's smile
The spirit moves tonight to make you shine
Remember David's words
The words he said would last all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, do you have the answer?
Do you have the answer?

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The day that David died
The world stood still
The stars refused to shine
And now he's far away from love
That was his only crime

The spirit moves tonight
To make your young heart
Make your young heart shine
The words he said to us
I'll carry with me for all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the question?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

Walking on the surface of the Moon

Left me gasping
For the precious air that's over my head 
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in

Saw my reflection in the mirror
Saw my image standing by a wall
I tried to touch the glass
But it shattered and it began to fall
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in 
Over my head
I think I'm in

Another starving baby's cry
A dying heart that's still made bold
Another coke another lie
A naked man I stand alone
Searching for the easy answer
Searching for a love that has no pain
Under the circumstances
The walls of love caved in again
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in

Trying to change my direction
To go where I was once before

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm trying to break all connections
Burning a hole in my heart
Trying to transfer affection
Is starting to tear me apart

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own
And there's no way to carry on
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm tired but then on reflection
It's so hard to open my eyes
To try reaching out for affection
It's so hard to break the disguise

Hold on hold on"

What am I supposed to do with a hard time,
Especially from you?
The way that you smile
Reveals a shadow from the past

but you lied.

If I see you talking,
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?

You say it's over this time,
Emotions in the past.
remember last time?
You said it wouldn't last.

Another shadow from the past
When I thought I knew you,
Don't know why.
 
If I see you walking,
If I see you talking,
What am I supposed to do?

Yeah!

Reveals a moment that can't last.
I hear the door close.
Goodbye.

I want to swim in your emotion.

So don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Don't look behind you.
You don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

Whoa, to a new romance,

I'm drifting away from the shore.
I'll try not to look back in anger,
I've tried not to look back at all.

Back at all,

She moves like a shadow of night;
A figure from over the ocean,
A figure surrounded by the light.

Over the border."

Walked through the open door;
Walked through the darkest night
Throughout the brightest light.

I see a ship from a golden sky,
I sent a message. Will they understand it?

This isn't happening the way I planned it.

I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away.

A cloud appears above your head;
A beam of light comes shining down on you,
Shining down on you.
The cloud is moving nearer still.
Aurora borealis comes in view;
Aurora comes in view.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away.

Reached out a hand to touch your face;
You're slowly disappearing from my view;
Disappearing from my view.
Reached out a hand to try again;
I'm floating in a beam of light with you;
A beam of light with you.

Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

What happened to the wings that used to search the sky?
Where did the clouds all fly?
No sign of life around me, nothing anywhere.
This moment I should share.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

But I'm so glad I waited,
As I anticipated,
'Cause now I see you.

I see your points of silver piercing the night,
Moving towards my sight.
I'll never understand the lights up in the sky
No matter how I try.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.
