Exodus,Honor Killings,"Culture of honor, culture of shame
Imprisoned by the burqa
Her innocence to blame
Sharia law and the almighty Allah
Rule with the whip in hand
Divine decree alliance against women
Throughout the holy land

Buried alive, burned, mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated
Beg for mercy with no avail
Muslim teachings must prevail

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Father slays daughter
A husband his wife
A mother is killed by her son
Cut from the womb
Bastard infant is strangled
A page from the holy Quran
Honor killers, moral vigilantes
Wipe away the stain of shame
To protect the family honor
And restore the family name

Buried alive, burned, mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated
Beg for mercy with no avail
Muslim teachings must prevail

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Heed obey! Get on your knees and pray
Heed obey! Five times a day
Heed obey! Get on your knees and pray
Heed obey! Five times a day
We put thee on the path, so follow it
And follow not the whims of those who know not
Heed obey! Get on your knees and pray
Heed obey! A tortured body on display

Segregation discrimination female genital mutilation
Subordination banned from education
Actions and sayings of the first three generations
Forced into marriage against her own will
Dowry and bride price to seal the deal
Left to rot in solitude
Suicide is the only substitute

Buried alive burned mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated
Beaten tortured ostracized accused of being westernized

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Judge and jury with zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation"
Exodus,Wrapped in the Arms of Rage,"My angel in anger, keep me drunk with wrath
Hatred, my light upon my chosen path
No concern about the aftermath
No trepidation
The binds are broken, hold me back no more
Twisted fantasies I shall soon explore
Black angel walk with me forevermore
Begin my transformation

Divinity of death divine
Mercy withers on the vine
Pulse rushes, I'm set free from my cage
I no longer walk alone
Make her animosity my own
Crushing embrace
I'm wrapped in the arms of rage

Agitation is my patron lord
Miscreant seraphim of all abhorred
Her admiration is my just reward
My coronation
Delirium through her sweet caress
Heed her words, I never second-guess
Symphony of malice played at my request
Her proclamation

Divinity of death divine
Mercy withers on the vine
Pulse rushes, I'm set free from my cage
I no longer walk alone
Make her animosity my own
Crushing embrace
I'm wrapped in the arms of rage"
Exodus,Exodus,"It starts with life, a way to live
I love the sound of pain
The more it hurts the better I feel
The world will fall insane
It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

[Chorus]
Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

[Chorus]

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine
I tell you all it's the way to live
Get stronger on death glory
Infringing on sacrificial rites
Death's your final story

[Chorus]"
Exodus,No Love,"Come into my home
Black master rules the night
See the power start to surge
Upon a hellish sight
It's time to raise them up
Up from below the grave
White bones glow savagery
Provide the light we crave

[Chorus]
Turn to look at Baphomet
From below and not above
Welcome to my sacrifice
Tonight there'll be no love

The darkness is my lover
She makes he feel strong
Take what I want, when I want
At night I do no wrong
When I walk the streets
Got Loki on my side
Slit your throat, drink your blood
Who cares when others die

[Chorus]

You thought you'd live for oh 50 long
Now it's your turn to die
Live with Satan down in Hell
Born to forever cry
Took your life I don't feel bad
Born to live in hell
Died for nothing, slow decay
Your body starts to smell"
Exodus,Parasite,"A distant hum
Cuts right through the skies
Calling my attention I look up
I can't believe my eyes
Thousands and thousands
Hungry for our minds
They're biting, eating and controlling
Anything they find

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]
Run-but you can't hide
Blood-coming from inside
My mind-doesn't know wrong from right
Parasite!

A million more
Coming after me
They thrive on insecticide
They live on DDT
No poison can defeat
The never ending swarm
They'll eat you from inside out
You'll wish you were never born

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]

Run-but you can't hide
Blood-sucked from inside
My mind-doesn't know wrong from right
Parasite!

Now they're living in my brain
I'm destroying at their cue
A violent reaction starts within
And now I'm after you!
I'll grab you by your head
And split your skull open wide
The infestation in complete
You're dead but yet alive!

Coming down from behind
They've got no care for our kind
See the world bending down
On it's knees

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Brain Dead,"Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you
Die!

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

[Repeat x 12]
Brain dead"
Exodus,Low Rider (War Cover),"All my friends
Own a low rider
Low rider
Is a little higher

Low rider
Drives a little slower
Low rider
Is a little lower

Low rider
Don't use no gas now
Low rider
Don't drive too fast

Take a little trip and see
Take a little trip with me"
Exodus,Overdose (AC/DC Cover),"I never smoked with no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me something I never had
Pulled me down with you
Pulled me up, think I'm in love
Hope you can pull me through

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Oh woman you give to me
More than I can take
But listen honey, I don't mind
You're a habit I don't want to break
Don't want none of that hard stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in love, and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

Gee I was happy as a man could be
To far gone to escape
Power of love, don't pull me off
Just write on my grave:"
Exodus,Salt the Wound,"When I take your flesh and lacerate you
Exposing all your hate
There's nothing left but lies to throw away

Eviscerate you
Reduce you to your fate
Deleted and erased all your decay

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound

The bane of my existence cancerous
A tumor on my soul
Unnecessary wart upon my skin

Full of puss
You're a Judas and a troll
Lance the boil rooted deep within

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound

Rest assured when I pollute you
Your disease I will correct
My contagion
Only now I know the source

I uproot you
Lance the boil disinfect
Pestilence of ruin's run its course

When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound"
Exodus,Cutlass,"I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it's the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket

I think it's the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing

Right off the back all these niggas be fronting
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Get that gut feeling you know that they coming
You ain't got no paper ain't even worth running
Hoped out the cutlass and hopped in the bucket
Run in your mouth you'll get popped in your nugget
You had the ball then you dropped it then f*ck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don't let yourself be the next kiss opponent
No I ain't driving but yeah bitch I own it
Usually niggas get caught in the moment
I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones half ones even zips moving
We ain't even gonna talk about the bricks moving
Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin
Hard times come you just gotta get through 'em
These lil niggas got a lotta shit brewing
Feds get involved then alotta shit ruined
Used to spit at niggas now I spit through 'em
I don't wash clothes nigga I just get new ones
Real boss niggas it be hard to get to 'em
Yeah real low on the suckers
I walked out the trap house and hopped in the Cutlass

I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it's the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
I hopped in the Cutlass

My phone steady buzzin'
I think it's the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing

Where I'm from ain't nothing but survival
Before niggas pray the gonna pick up that rifle
Before niggas sleep they gonna camp out and snipe you
Wipe you off the face of the earth your face on a shirt
Ive been through in that phantom fly back to the place that I'm from
But not happy with that they took my brother the government kidnap and shit
I ain't just talking I ain't just rapping said it really happened
That's why I get on shit that you with and I vomit
I don't give a f*ck you know how Exo coming
It's beef I'm at you and I might be atacha woman
I make it look like you put time in for nothing
Don't make no sudden movements around me I'm clutching
These niggas haven't seen the money I'm touching
I even put their hands on cars that I'm pushing
But I ain't jumping for a nigga

I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it's the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing

Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing
Now I got money they can't tell me nothing"
Exodus,Black 13,"Darkness, your surest bet
Wage of sin and blood roulette
Laying the odds against your gods
High stakes and no regret
No parlay in this game of hell
Lose your soul, they sound the knell
Nothing ventured nothing gained
The cards foretell

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

Salvation, a game of chance
Roll of the dice, the devil's dance
Speculate and tempt your fate
Life paid in advance
Double down and pull one more
Even money you even the score
Can't renege you pay the vig
You're spoken for

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

Eternity on the money line
Cloven one pulls three of a kind
You bet the spread and end up dead
Too late to change your mind
You went all in, didn't hedge your bets
Dark bookmaker collects all debts
Death begets the devil's hand
The wheel resets

The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride"

Exodus,Collateral Damage,"Blitzkrieg, insurgence
Under the thumbs of the powers that be
Conflict, tension, unlawful detention
They don't give a f*ck about you or me
We are all just collateral damage
The shit they step in on their way
Just puppets used to their advantage
To chew up and throw away

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce, we
Decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die, we
Ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end, we are
Betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid

Illuminati of the one percent
We chase their carrot on a string
Wall street deceit all stuck on repeat
Peons serving to the kings
To them it's all just a natural selection
A birth right of gluttony
Like a kind of Immaculate Conception
Of inbred conformity

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore

Betrayed, unafraid

Collateral damage repaid

Street punk makes a fatal mistake
Dared to look him in the eye
Ten rounds, just standing his ground
Only choice, he had to die
Just another violent confrontation
Murder in the first degree
Another ready, aim fire
Do more time for petty larceny

Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is me declaration of war

Fight, oppress

Exodus,Body Harvest,"Awakened in ice near dead in a tub
Organs are cut out and gone, you pay the price
Phone and note call 911!!
Startled and scared
What to do next?
Who must be called?
Or will it be death!

Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest
For sale for all

The meat wagon greets you
And speeds to a thrust
Hurry to sew on the patch
Strapped to the table and cut to the bone
The blood type is just not a match
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death!

This is no law
Bold Harvest
Left there to rot
Body Harvest
More organs sought
Body Harvest
For sale for all

Awake in a room dripping with blood
The hunted has turned to the hunt
Attention is turning from me onto you
You have the parts that I want
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death!

Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

Exodus,My Last Nerve,"I'm so irritated
Being kicked to the curb
Every time you open your mouth
Your try to get in the last word
Those who live in glass houses
Should not be throwing stones
It all comes crashing down
You never left well enough alone

Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve

So many excuses
Always laying the blame
You're always pointing the finger
Adding fuel to the flame
Another slander, another slur
Another hollow apology
So many verbal abuses
Believe your own mythology

Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve

I'll never be your scapegoat
Quote unquote
Your underling
Red light, left turn, you never learned
A crash fit for a king

Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve"
Exodus,Numb,"Nothing seems to faze me anymore
Indurate, senseless, dead soul to the core
This lift has left me cold, unfeeling
I find pity so unappealing

I'm callous, remorseless
Sympathy just seems so useless
Black-hearted and worthless
Desensitized and ruthless
Compassion vacated
I'm so disassociated
I'm sick of what I've become
But this world has rendered me
So fucking numb

Dead body on the street
Won't give it a second glance
Famine, poverty, just victims of circumstance
So bored by all killing and the thieving
I just don't have the time for the grieving

I'm callous, remorseless
Sympathy just seems so useless
Black-hearted and worthless
Desensitized and ruthless
Compassion vacated
I'm so disassociated
I'm sick of what I've become
But this world has rendered me
So fucking numb

I don't care that I don't care
That I don't feel a thing
I don't give a shit that I don't give a f*ck
Not a single tear it brings
When oh so many horrors
Are lined up on parade
Chaos and disorder
Are the tools of our trade
I'm fucking numb

Was a time when it all was shocking
Now I yawn when death comes knocking
I feel no sorrow that I feel this way
Now watch it all rot and waste away

I'm callous, remorseless
Sympathy just seems so useless
Black-hearted and worthless
Desensitized and ruthless
Compassion vacated
I'm so disassociated
I'm sick of what I've become
But this world has rendered me
So fucking numb"
Exodus,Food for the Worms,"There is no afterlife
We all just decompose
No Heaven's pearly gates
Just tags upon our toes
A slow putrescence
From the time the life is shorn
Feast for the maggots
Reborn
Wet and adipocerous
Our flesh turns in to wax
Enter hypostasis
Pale skin discolored black
Regeneration
When life has adjourned
Insect infestation
Our favors are returned

When from this world we are unbound
We're food for the worms
When they plant me in the ground I'm
Food for the worms

The reaper beats at the gate of every man
Lies fill the Bible, Tanakh and Quran
It matters not which dogma you believe
Our bodies are left to rot like fallen leaves
The circle of life it marches on
We fertilize the ground we walk upon
Feast for the vultures' all that's left
While hope spring eternal for the bereft

The throes of rigor mortis
Forensic certainty
Heaven, Olam Ha-Ba
Fairy tales of lunacy
We're vessels for the larvae
Not vessels for the soul
Transform to liquefaction
Make all nature whole
Food for the worms"
Exodus,Hammer and Life,"Born again harder
Than I was before
Bringing the hammer down
Is more than metaphor
I live by the steel
Die by the blade
What reason is there to be
If you're living life afraid?

[Chorus]
The hammer is my symbol
The banner that I wave
The motto of my creed
Carved upon my grave
I life for the here and now
I live for the knife
My coat of arms
Is the hammer and life

Fear and cowardice
Harbingers of demise
Strength and the will to fight
Will lead you to the prize
Glory to all of those
Who conquer to the end
Honor the hammer
On it you can depend

[Chorus]"
Exodus,The Ballad of Leonard and Charles,"Lecherous inhuman monsters
Piteous crimes carried out
Patriarchs to the lunatic fringe
They venerate what has been done
They turned a small town in northern California
Into the haunt of the damned
Devoid of all comprehension
The most vicious hateful part of man

[Chorus]
Dragging their victims into lunacy
And putting it all on film
Wretched dregs of society
Killers of children
Rapists of women
Sado-sexual violence

Immoral killing with indifference
Aroused as your victims cry
Unjust pain they love to inflict
Breaking their souls, then their minds
Malevolent and rancid perversions
The outcome is always death
Bodies thrown down into a hole
Maggots consuming the flesh

[Chorus]

Fear-A macabre madness
Fiendish carnage with rabid butchery
Pain-sadistically tortured
Rejoicing in their victims slavery
Rape-forced violations
Malicious desecration of the thrall
Slave-depraved exploitation
A sickening anguish for them all
Sado-sexual violence
Sick-twisted rituals
Vile defiling of the enslaved
Lie-decimate aspirations abused
At the hands of the deranged
Kill-and slaughter the damned
With gruesome and heinous suffering
Death-merciless killing
With despicable and cruel agony
Sado-sexual violence

Excoriate the legal system
Exposing all of its flaws
One kills himself with cyanide
The other makes a mockery of the law
The act of killing eroticized
Dismissive to call you insane
Committed horrific and brutal crimes
Then laughing with total disdain

Exodus,Beyond the Pale,"Sinners heart can't think or feel
The sharp sting of slicing steel
Punish, kill, repeat
The death caress, so bittersweet
I live outside the rule of law
My one decree is shock and awe
Black sheep of my kind
Progeny of hate refined

Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why, still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

Take the gun, take the knife
Take the pain, then take the life
My taste for homicide
Is rising up and amplified
Bloody deeds, my only friend
With me til the bitter end
Together we are one
And our work has just begun

Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why, still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

[Chorus]
Plea for mercy
To no avail
Killers of my kind live
Beyond the pale
In this world of mine
They say I don't belong
Something that feels so right
Could never be so wrong
Plea for clemency
You're wasting time
My routine
Is the scene of the crime
I make the Devil laugh
And Angels wail
Forever I will reside
Beyond the pale

Heartless bastard cold as ice
Victim of my own device
The strong prey on the weak
Dead men, they never speak
All part of man's condition
On this path to our perdition
We kill along the way
Death never takes a holiday

Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why, still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer),"Everything around me ignites my rage
I'm burning with animosity
Everywhere I look another war to wage
Filled with purpose of singularity
Got my hollow points, got my magazines
Wrote my manifesto of decay
Commencement of the killing at the university
Antipathy, the lesson of the day
They never should have pushed me away

[Chorus]
Student bodies lying dead in the halls
A blood splattered treatise of hate
Class dismissed is my hypothesis
Gun fire ends the debate
All I ever wanted was a little affection
But no one ever gave it to me
My hate primer's the result of my rejection
You'll die for it, and I'll die for thee

The halls of learning now a shooting range
My final exam with a gun
Killing everyone who ever thought me strange
My bloody dissertation has begun
Pomp and circumstance replaced by bullet wounds
The smell of gunpowder on the air
Murder is the nightmare of this afternoon
My malevolence, your cross to bear
All because of my despair

[Chorus]

Hate lives in me
Hate lives in me
Hate I need it and it needs me
Hate I feed it and it fed me
Hate I breed it and it bred me
Hate
Hate I read it and it read me
Hate I lead it and it led me
Hate I bleed it and it bled me
I breathe it in, and it breathes through me

While SWAT teams swarm all around the quad
The symposium of slaughter carries on
Smith and Wesson is my only God
And the line in the sand has been drawn
Valedictorian of violence
Graduation day, one bullet remains
Charles Whitman set the precedent
I pull the trigger and blow out my brains
They never knew I was insane

[Chorus]

I instruct you
And I destruct you
I deconstruct you
Until my hate has fucked you"
Exodus,Downfall,"A crumbling empire
Where angels fear to tread
Into the ruins of a civilization
A society ripped to shreds
No semblance of order
Into the world which I abjure
Where the bloody blade is forged
Am I the cause of the cure?

[Chorus]
Our destiny is soon revealed
Battle strewn, no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight
Downfall!
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand?
Bonfire of the vanities and spite

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sewn
When all the marble palaces
Are blackened, sacked and burned
Will we understand man's ignorance
Through all the lessons learned?

[Chorus]

Fall!
Fall!
Fall!
Downfall!

So quick to claim the credit due
Yet no one takes the blame
Like Nero played his violin
While watching Rome in flames
Implosion of our nations through
Decisions of its kings
Downfall of our creation
It's the end of everything

[Chorus]"
Exodus,March of the Sycophants,"Do as they say, not as they do
March to the tune of the Christian right
Hypocrites, their rules they don't apply to you
Parading in the name of Christ
Former leader in a hotel room
Smoking crank and sucking cock
Guilty as sin yet innocence presumed
Still they talk the talk

Christian soldiers
Trudging off to war
Behind the cross of Jesus
And still they

[Chorus]
March!
March!
It's the march of the sycophants, they
March!
March!
March in time to the rhythm of the right, they
March!
March!
Here come the sheep, all promenade, they
March!
March!
Everybody loves a parade

Masters of hyperbole
They claim to know what's wrong or right
The mob led to believe so easily
Like a moth to a light
Pro-life, anti-life and so sincere
Battalions of the dull of mind
Obeying all they read, see or hear
The ignorant leading the blind

Christian soldiers
Trudging off to war
Behind the cross of Jesus
And still they

[Chorus]

Brain dead plebeians
Rally 'round the Bible and the flag
Their prophets are a plumber
And a small minded rifle packing hag
One nation under God
And one under the thumb
Marching to the beat of a different kind of drum
It's the march of the sycophants!

Town hall rabble
Cry liberty and justice for the few
It's the end of they world as they know it
That's what they'll say to you
Conspiracy theories eaten raw like meat
Fed by the mother of lies
They suck straight from the teat
It's the march of the sycophants!"
Exodus,Nanking,"Sadistic soldiers of the rising sun
1937's when the rape had begun
The ancient city fell under imperial rule
By an engine of war and lust, savage and cruel

Assembly line efficiency of killing machines
Unbridled fury of the sick and obscene
Systematic sexual degradation
The more perverse the greater exaltation

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
They turned the waters of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside and brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

Bestial and violent, six weeks of suffering
So black was the day they marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning

Tanks ran over men nailed to boards
Decapitations with an officer's sword
Gang rape of women, both the young and the old
Frozen to death in waters ice cold

Disembowelment, some are buried alive
Suicide's preferred for those who survive
The stench of corpses everywhere in the streets
Dogs feast on the rotting meat

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
They turned the waters of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside and brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

Bestial and violent, six weeks of suffering
So black was the day they marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
It was the rape of Nanking

Thousands forced into prostitution
So many years and still no restitution
The carnage of Carthage so easily outdone
Add all the blood you get 1200 tons

Massacre removed from history books
No mention of men hung from iron hooks
All counter to the rules of war
They made a city an army's whore

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
They turned the waters of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside and brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

Bestial and violent, six weeks of suffering
So black was the day, they marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
It was the rape of Nanking"
Exodus,"Burn, Hollywood, Burn","Land of enchantment and fake reality
Where they put in vitro breeding machines
On the cover of a magazine
Trailer trash and human freaks
They grab their minute of fame
And still the puppets watch
And everybody knows the names
That's why I say

Burn, Hollywood, burn
When it's dead and gone we'll never miss a thing
Burn, Hollywood, burn
No more rotten to the core little sweet sixteens
Burn. Hollywood, burn
Time's running out on their minute of fame
Let's douse the fire by pissing on the flames

So young, bitch and famous
Hotel heiress, glamor queen
The only reason we know your name
Is bad night vision pornography
From the ""real"" housewives of Botox hills
To the cunts of Bel-Aire
You can't look away from the cathode ray
Why does anybody fucking care

Burn, Hollywood, burn
When it's dead and gone we'll never miss a thing
Burn, Hollywood, burn
No more rotten to the core little sweet sixteens
Burn. Hollywood, burn
Time's running out on their minute of fame
Let's douse the fire by pissing on the flames"
Exodus,Democide,"Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds for the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth hell bent on their genocide
Complete destruction, blood lust seduction
Drinking warm blood with a smile
Beyond the horror, they're born to suffer
Hundreds of thousands defiled

Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned

Dissected while still alive, the violence you live to endure
Cleansing, inherently violent, purging the world for the pure
Triumph of evil, hatred primeval
Unenlightened corrupted souls
Orgy of murder, heartless and vile
Merchants of death in control

Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned, war is hell

Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds for the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth hell bent on their genocide

Exodus,The Sun Is My Destroyer,"Immortal subjugator, usurper, dominator
Blood ruler of the dark
Lord of the shadow world, flag of black unfurled
Foul, unholy patriarch
Enslaver of mankind, king of all unkind
Light ender in black domain
I fear only the dawn, at war with the rising sun
Eternal dusk ordained

I lurk beside you, never to abide you
I live inside you, always to divide you
I stand between you, certain to unclean you
The night is my savior
The sun is my destroyer

Despotic tyrants liar, judgment always dire
Unrepentant fear machine
Dream world paralyzer, re of man, none the wiser
Beneath the surface, site unseen
My only enemy, the day, behest color, shades of grey
Rejoice in the coming of the night
Nightmares come all too real, dest horror soon revealed
Rising with the dying of the light

I lurk beside you, never to abide you
I live inside you, always to divide you
I stand between you, certain to unclean you
The night is my savior
The sun is my destroyer

In my dominion, day meets its demise
Ultraviolet adversary, like an open wound to cauterize
The night's assailant is the coming of the morning sun
Illuminescent antagonist, smashed to oblivion
I am god here, in the bowels of the human mind
Creature of imagination, born of the impure and unrefined
I prey on your fear, take all you hold dear and then I use it against you
So unwise for you to close your eyes
That's when I come to dispense you

Malignant dream accuser
Pleasant thought reverser
Loathsome bringer of dread
Slumber now vitiated
Sweet dreams abominated
Terrors better left unsaid
Villainous machination
Sub conscious tribulation
Tremble at the coming of the twilight
Rising with the setting sun
Returning when the day's undone
Ensuring an end to all good nights

I lurk beside you, never to abide you
I live inside you, always to divide you
I stand between you, certain to unclean you
The night is my savior
The sun is my destroyer"
Exodus,Good Riddance,"Cesspool in orbit, our end has begun
We live on the third lump of shit from the sun
Planet in peril, but why give a f*ck
Soon the earth will run out of luck
Wreck it all until the land is stripped
Rejoice in the coming apocalypse
Sing loud the world's last lullaby
But my replies

Good riddance, goodbye
So long to this fucking world, sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance, goodnight
Adios planet earth, now die

Parasitic infestation, never ending procreation
Our shit stained constellation headed for its cancellation
Eternity of desecration, another misread calculation
Give the earth one last ovation before it starts the final
Crash and burn

Get down to business, cut to the chase
It's time for mankind's fall from grace
The end's coming sooner than you'll ever know
So sit back, relax and enjoy the show
No time to cry, I won't shed a tear
This is, after all the event of the year
You testify, but my replies

Good riddance, goodbye
So long to this fucking world, sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance, goodnight
Adios planet earth, now die"
Exodus,Iconoclasm,"Man creates the god
And the god destroys the man
Betrayed by their own invention
The shepherd butches the lamb
A lion at the head of an army
Of sheep when comes time to feed
Like Saturn devoured his children
They’re consumed by belief

[Chorus]
I am the chosen one
And I hold the key
Behold the prodigal son
This good I do lives long after me
Let iconoclasm set you free

Christ is the same yesterday
And today, forever a lie
They concocted the heavens
To keep all the puppets in line
Narcotic, addictive desire
To believe they won’t go to hell
A dog that has bitten its master
That it once knew so well

[Chorus]

Figment of imagination
Oracle of ignorance
Corrupter of society
Killer of reason and innocence
An object of man’s creation
Made to fill the hole inside
But that abyss has only been opened wide

Wolves they guard the flock
And they slaughter the sick and the weak
Sorrow is all that they find
When salvation is all that they seek
The truth is the greatest lord
Where no fool commands the wise
Religion ten times undone
No room for compromise

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Funeral Hymn,"Let not the sun go down on my wrath
I let it shake the world
Vengeance is the grudge I bear
Flag of reckoning unfurled
You are the architect
Of your own demise
So smile no more
I am the gatekeeper,
And you are mine for evermore

[Chorus]
Come greet the reaper
You know the time is nigh
This is the day of reckoning,
Your time to die
Brave men they spin in fear
At the sound of my voice
Say goodbye to life so dear
You no longer have a choice

Burnt black and silent,
Rust and blood
Upon my reaper's blade
I come collect the tolls
Gather up all the debts unpaid
I call when you least expect
But when you deserve it the most
Behold the timekeeper
The end is getting close

[Chorus]

The dead no longer have
A cross to bear
The dead no longer have
Need to despair
Death has come
And set the snare
Death will come
When you are unaware

The misbegotten have the gall
To think them safe and sound
They try to cheat the reaper
Scatter, hide, no matter, found
The wheel of life is standing still
For them it turns no more
Now comes the soul keeper
And you become my whore

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Children of a Worthless God,"Brainwashed into madness,
Your children are killers without fear
Manipulate and dominate,
Stealing their lives for your hate
Twisted perverted minds,
Think as we do or you die
Demagogue, fanatical tyrant
A false prophet seething with lies

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Propagation of violence
Your one god a disease upon man
Execution, crucifixion
The answer for those not in your plan
The penalty for contempt against your god
Is death and nothing else
Ignorant infidels
Are subhuman and will all burn in hell

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

Smite the perverts and the obstinate
Praising the death of the free
United States of Islam
That's what you would like it to be
Violate the unbelievers
Praising crimes against man
Human rights mean nothing
Doctrine of death a scourge upon man

I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god"
Exodus,Deathamphetamine,"Life spent with lips on glass
Another hit, just one more blast
How long can you make it last?
Hit the pipe and vaporize
Feel the rush, so energized
Your longs being to crystallize
Try to stem the tide
From another five day ride
Don't you know your dead inside?
The world spins out of control
All amped up, nowhere to go
A glass house is all you know

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Spun and sleep deprived
The calendar burns before your eyes
Another hit, for now revived
So many sleepless nights
Only whet your appetite
Strike a match, the torch ignites
See the shards start cracking back
Watch them turn your world to black
While waiting for the heart attack
All your dreams are dead and gone
I tell you now, it won't be long
Before death ends this marathon

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!

Withered and sucked up
You're wasting away
Eyes sunken deep in your skull
You care not about yourself
Nor any other
Only if the pipe is full
Lick your lips
As you hover around the glass
Anxiously awaiting your turn
Depressed and paranoid
It's all gone to hell
Inhale as your world burns

Lost everything you own
Now waiting by the telephone
For the dope man to come home
All your friends and family
Are sickened by your need for speed
Only driven to exceed
So many years, so little time
For you to halt your life's decline
You've got to read the signs
Everything has come unwound
You've got to turn this shit around
Before you're six feet underground

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine!"
Exodus,Blacklist,"It is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out, right you off, there's never enough
Ways to throw you away

[Chorus]
You'd better start runnin'
'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist

You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out, write you off, when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris

[Chorus]

For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man

For those who died in vain
Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War

Kill it if we don't understand it
Pray to god and your fate is sealed
As you die alone in the killing fields

Exodus,Shovel Headed Kill Machine,"Tank treads crushing over piles of broken bones
Siege engine revving and coming to atone
Poisonous black smoke billows from its eyes
Unholy war machine can't be compromised
Fueled by the corpses feted fleshed
Never turning back forward to the death
Its only mission is killing everything
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

So inhuman you don't speak its name
Its artillery sets the world aflame
Mechanical demon rolling 'cross the sand
Blood stained thing scorching black the holy land
Skin made of iron, heart made of steel
Lubricated by the blood beneath its wheels
Reclaiming the world for its king
It's the shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel headed kill machine!"

Ignite it, delight it, the flames grow higher
Burn the world upon a funeral pyre

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

Destroy it all, show no inhibition
Revel and rejoice in unbridled demolition
Smash it, f*ck it, nothing will remain
Detect it and wreck it but never take the blame

(Raze!) Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
(Raze!) Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

Lay waste to the world without hesitation
Break it, take it, you don't have any reason
F*ck it, destruct it, it's demolition season"

Destroy the monuments

Prepare for coup d'etat

So begins our final riot act
Now that your in, there'll be no turning back

Exodus,"As It Was, As It Soon Shall Be","We didn’t pay attention

Soon the sands in the desert
Will melt from the atomic blast

For the coming of world war
Thousands die in the sand
And I still don’t understand what for

[Chorus]
As it was, as it soon shall be
We’re teetering on the brink
Of a world war III
A repetition of history
As you soon shall see
As it was, as it soon shall be

War mongering leader of ours
Waves the flag of democracy
Sending our men out to die
In the name of bureaucracy
The oil fields of Iraq
Are overflowing with blood
Another man dies but the lies
Rain down like a flood

[Chorus]

No weapons of mass destruction
No threat to me
Just one man’s agenda for war,
Not a land of the free
I never gave a shit
About the Middle East
But now we lie in the bed that we’ve
Made, start the atomic feast

Exodus,The Atrocity Exhibition,"The glorious frailty of the human mind
Leads us to deceive the mother of mankind
Nature is our master, we serve her through our deeds
She teaches us that only death is guaranteed
If there was a hell, there must I ever be
Eternal life in heaven is but a fallacy
So if death is nothing, but a path to be trod
Walk with me and let me introduce you to your God

Come see an exhibition of atrocity
An ocean of eternity
One in which the shore you’ll never see
Or your God of make believe

You speak to the sky and no one answers back
And yet you wager the word of God is fact
The horrors we imagine in vivid clarity
Become a spectacle, your God’s atrocities
A mirror image, reflection of your soul
Just nature’s play, all her children have a role
God’s an actor, the world nature’s stage
Our fates are scripted like so many
Letters on a page

A composition of atrocity
The Story of Christianity
A fairy tale of tyranny
Recipe for catastrophe

Man’s inclination
Is to bend those who oppose to our will
Does your great creator think
The good are better made by ills?
Dream after dream, time after time
He who conquers endures
The grand design of the mother
We the disease, and her the cure

Unsatisfied longing for the slaughter
The master often slays her sons and her daughters
Death is but and undress of skin and of bone
When you return to her, no sins to atone
The ending is the same for the vile and devout
Let all the poisons that lurk in the mind
Hatch out
She has predetermined our end
Nothing more she will portend"
Exodus,The Garden of Bleeding,"Viscerated bodies
Planted deep beneath the earth
They fertilize the soil
And feed for all they’re worth
Within the garden
Of unearthly delights
True meaning of horror’s found
And hell’s within our sights

[Chorus]
He plants the seeds
The germinate
Black misdeeds, they pollinate
Within the garden of bleeding’s
Where the devil waits
To introduce you to your fate

Endless orchards dot the land
Of corpses up on spikes
Beauty’s in the eye of the
Beheaded on a pike
Bathed in lakes of fire
Until a cinder’s what remains
The stench of death it makes
The flowers bloom in his domain

[Chorus]

Bodies hang from branches
Like grapes hang from the vine
Garlands made of human flesh
They decorate his shrine
On the wind and through the trees,
The cries of suffering
For this is the garden
Of the king of the unclean"
Exodus,Bedlam 1-2-3,"Turn on the havoc

Exodus,Intro/Scar Spangled Banner,"Oh say can you fucking see
The missiles fall like rain
Bloody mountains majesty
Dead bodies on the plain
By the bombing's eerie light
See the crimsons waves of red
What so proudly they all fell
The twilight of the dead

America the violent
The indifferent
God shit is grace on me
America the arrogant
The belligerent
Will live in infamy
We the people, for no people
Secure the blessings of tragedy
Do or don't we have established
The scar spangled banner

We pledge allegiance to no god
Only to the blood
Liberty is just a dream
When dying in the mud
This, the land of the deceived, home of the depraved
Bombs, they drop like falling leaves
And the deadly flag still waves

[Chorus]

Red the beautiful color of blood
Flowing like a stream
White the color of bleaching bone
Lovely and obscene
Blue the bruising color of flesh
Battered, ripped and torn
The colors of the flag of hate
Of violence and porn
What you see is what you get
You haven't see the bloody trail yet
I'm no patriot, just a hate-triot

Blood sport, my sure bet
See the flag, get a body bag

Nothing left, no one saved
'Cause our goddamn motherfucking bloody ass
Banner still waves"

Such a symbol of loss
Since what seems like the dawn of time
It's just an engine of grief
Yeah, a bloody belief
One that has no reason or rhyme

And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock

[Chorus]
I believe in nothing
Least of all in the word of shit
So hide in your shroud of urine
Because I can't take the smell of it

God isn't great
Just an icon of hate
Intolerance and despise
Believe in me
And I will set you free
I never heard a bigger pack of lies
It's ludicrous
That anyone of us
Would want to be lead by the blind
It's all in vain
It'll be your bane
If you're looking for the divine

[Chorus]

Forgive and forget
Such an empty threat
Religion at the end of the blade
The insanity
Of Christianity
Is just a fucking masquerade
You're cruci-fucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Forward March,"In life you're moving forward
But sometime for the worse
Always keep a step ahead
Never in reverse
The cards are stacked against you
In everything you do
But you try to get out alive
When you don't have a clue
You always feel the tension
Breathing at your back
To be the best that you can be
To be on the attack
Kicking down the wall
And kicking your face in
Means I'm moving forward
My new life can begin

Forward march in your face
Taking back, taking place
Before you die, living fast
Take a chance, hauling ass

Never, no never, no never
Move in reverse

Here I am; I'm moving straight
Fuckin' forward, and I'm taking all
The steps to blow on right past you
I'm never gonna back down to you
And all your people 
Who think that you're the best
No one can beat you
Well, I've got some news for you, you motherfucker
There's a new man in town who isn't any sucker
So if you don't back down
I'll put my bat to an
Angry motherfucker such as yourself

Now I'm going to wipe out
All those who say they're first
I'll be the first in line
My attitude's the worst
Because I am so spoiled
And never second best
I will leave you in the dust
And lay your ass to rest
So never underestimate
The mind of evil thoughts
I will bring you down
Spit you out before I'm caught
Because I have the power
And the upper hand
Everybody in the way
Will know that I'm the man

Forward march in your face
Taking back, taking place
Before you die, living fast
Take a chance, hauling ass

Never, no never, no never
Move in reverse"
Exodus,Culling the Herd,"They're everywhere and everyplace
Scum of the human race
Stickin' to my skin just like a rash
Society's their scapegoat
But I am the antidote
And it's time to take out the trash
The world's a big cesspit
Of puke and piss and dogshit
But I ain't gonna be its whore
Follow and I'll lead the way
Predators are now the prey
Results like these are hard to ignore

You may think I'm insane
Or maybe just a little absurd
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

I know I'm not the only one
Who thinks that something must be done
To clean the garbage up off the street
Dare to look me in the eye
I bring the truth, never lie
To me, they're just another piece of meat
The punishment will be swift and sure
For this disease, I am the cure
No problem, the doctor is in
My prescription for a better life's
A riffle or a razor knife
Remove whoever's under your skin

But please, don't call it a murder
Cause murder's such a dirty word
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

When will everyone realize
Some people should be sterilized
Their tubes are only fit to be tied
All they do is shit and breed
To ignorant to ever succeed
Stupidity should not be multiplied
Lend them not a helping hand
Or the future will be damned
The world will take a turn for the worse
The human race should be purified
Or we'll all be mongrelized
Implement the cure for the curse

You may think I'm a madman
Or maybe just a little disturbed
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling the herd
I'm just culling
I'm just culling
I'm just culling
I'm just culling the herd"
Exodus,Sealed with a Fist,"The honeymoons over and the loves gone sour
Her nagging has got you down
But you picked the wrong way to deal with it
You chose to slap her around
When you exchanged your wedding vows
Nobody said ""you may now fist the bride""
Now that the little woman went and got her gun
The love ain't all that died

[Chorus]
Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Began for her when the bullet's hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fist

When she took your hand in marriage
It didn't mean right across the face
Small woman, big man, it takes a lot of guts
You're just a pussy in the first place
But now that your wedding chamber's
The one the bullet's in
Brave man, look at you, not so tough
When the hammer's cockin'

[Chorus]

The little woman had all the shit that she could take
Her intuition said ""lock and load""
He-man, what's your plan to get out of this
She's gonna fill your ass with bullet holes
Guess who's bigger when she's squeezing the trigger
I got news, it isn't you
When they carry your body out over the threshold
You'll wish you never said ""I do""

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Throwing Down,"Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you

I get off on negativity
Makes me laugh to see your strife
I won't succumb to your numb
I owe nothing to no one
Are you sick of me
I don't care
Never be a kiss ass
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you

Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you

Throwing down"
Exodus,Tempo of the Damned,"When you feel the darkness calling out your name
Don't try to fight the power surge
Don't you laugh, for this is not a game
Your powerless, don't resist the urge
So many black hearts answering the call
Legions of the musically possessed
Congregations joining in our free-for-all
Unleashing all the rage they've repressed

[Chorus]
Come to us
Succumb to lust
Giving in to our ministry of sin
You know the drill
Do as you will
Dance like the demons of the din
All will yearn
For our nocturne
The dawning of our cult is at hand
Come and pray
We know the way
Bow to the tempo of the damned

We are all leaders of the horde
Keepers of the apes of wrath
Heed the call of the volume lord
High priest of the bloodbath
Serve unto us, surrender us your souls
And great rewards you'll receive
And when the tempo has taken the control
Even the heretic's will believe

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Now Thy Death day Come,"Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Man's bloody inclination
God's final abdication
Angels weep on bended knee
So beings the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man

My will be done
Now they death day come

Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the malediction
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for man's lament

My will be done
Now they death day come

On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
And the one you so revere

The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to apologize
Can you feel the irony?
War for all eternity

My will be done
Now they death day come"
Exodus,Karma's Messenger,"Unrelenting vengeance
On man for all his sins
Ruthless eradication
Duty of reckoning to begin
The human race is a cancer
Fueled by power and lust
Punishment is the answer
And payment is your blood

Death and destruction
Hellish cries are the sound
Headlong into hell
Retribution is now
Inflict the suffering
Let the punishment fit the crime
I belong to vengeance
And vengeance is mine

Choking out the life
Of every living thing
History repeats itself
World brought down by greed
Prostitute the truth
Stealing from the blind
Arrogant indifference
The raping of mankind

Death and destruction
Hellish cries are the sound
Headlong into hell
Retribution is now
Inflict the suffering
Let the punishment fit the crime
I belong to vengeance
And vengeance is mine"
Exodus,Shudder to Think,"You hit rock bottom, now where do you go from here?
Sunk down, locked up, all you do is disappear
All your promises are all just a pack of lies
You've got nothing, something you can't recognize

Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew

I can't take any more excuses
No longer needed and you don't have nay uses
Washed up, washed out, what more can I say
You better start filling out your resume

Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew

Everything was there for the taking
Too busy with the lying and flaking
Drugged up, fell out, too many second chances
Nothing else to do under the circumstances

Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew"
Exodus,I Am Abomination,"I am affliction
The cause of all that ails you
I am addiction
That binds and assails you
I am the chaos
I'm the thing that makes you hurt
Laughing at your loss

Just underneath your skin
Is evil's origin
Come see the face of devastation
You are me, I am abomination

I am the bleeding
When you open up the vein
I am the overdose
That rushes to your brain
I'm all you've come to loathe
All you've known to hate
I am the hunter
When you come to take the bait

Just underneath your skin
Is evil's origin
Come see the face of devastation
You are me, I am abomination

I am Jehovah
I am the virgin whore
I am the battlefield
I'm pestilence and war
I am the monster
That lurks beneath your bed
I'm all perversions
Trapped inside your head"
Exodus,Altered Boy,"Unholy pedophile
Preying on the innocent
Protected by the papacy
So called men of enlightenment
Children fingered by the hand of God
Raped in the name of Christ
They took a vow of chastity
Yet have torn asunder so many a life

Chicken hawks of the Catholic Church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy

Men so benevolent
In a position of trust
Molesting children by the score
Rendering young life straight into the dust
They're church is their Golgotha
Their crucified by the priest
Child becomes the victim
Holy Father becomes the beast

Chicken hawks of the Catholic Church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy

Multi-million dollar payouts
Restitution for their crimes
This vile sickness
Cut so many down in their prime
All the bishops and the cardinals
Tried to hide it away
In the parish and cathedrals
The predators come to prey

Chicken hawks of the Catholic Church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy"
Exodus,Going Going Gone,"A straight razor and a flick of the wrist
Brass knuckles and a willing fist
A big knife and a little scream
They do wonders for my self-esteem
Warm blood and a cold embrace
The catch is better than the chase
They all ask why I'm doing this
Violence is bliss

What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone

Two things that I can't ignore
Dark nights and an unlocked door
I get the feeling and I follow through
I get high like I'm sniffing glue
It's time to let the games commence
This really helps my self-confidence
Blood orgy for the hedonist
Violence is bliss

What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone

I never leave any telltale traces
Only fear frozen on dead faces
An orgasm of depravity
It's the best kind of therapy
I always flee the scene of the crime
No victims, left to drop the dime
So many lives yet to be dismissed
Violence is bliss"
Exodus,Now Thy Death Day Come,"Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated

Exodus,44 Magnum Opus,"Can't withhold my anger won't control my rage
My bloodlust will be sated
I'm locked and loaded and ready to engage
Killing everything I've always hated

A motherfucking Van Gogh with a gun
About to paint his masterpiece
Blow the world into oblivion
Paint with the blood of the deceased

Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony

Written in human debris
Art and murder true synonymy
No appeal, no ""I got a raw deal"", I don't give a f*ck
One thing is clear, I've got a deaf ear

[Pre-Chorus]
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop till the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide

[Chorus]
The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
My .44
Magnum
My .44 magnum opus

Bodies are the canvas, ammo is the vision
For my greatest work of art
I'm waging my own inquisition
Tearing everything apart

I'm building a monument to horror
A temple so divine
Remembrance to those I've massacred
Death the grand design

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

People will stare in disbelief and awe
When they see what I've created
Still life, no life beautiful and raw
The world will be captivated

Never have they seen something so ambitious
Like nothing done before
A work so terrible and vicious
A masterpiece of gore

Exodus,War is my Shepherd,"You put your faith in Christianity
I put mine in artillery
My M-16, my lord and savior
Christ never done me a motherfucking favor

[Chorus]
Pay for all of those in pain
For those who died in vain
Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War
War
War
War is my shepherd

Hate it if we can't comprehend it
Kill it if we don't understand it
Pray to god and your fate is sealed
As you die alone in the killing fields

Farwell, Graham and Farahkahn
They need god, I need napalm
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition
My sermon is my demolition

War
War is
War is my
War is my shepherd"
Exodus,Scar Spangled Banner,"Oh say can you fucking see
The missiles fall like rain
Bloody mountains majesty
Dead bodies on the plain
By the bombing's eerie light
See the crimsons waves of red
What so proudly they all fell
The twilight of the dead

[Chorus]
America the violent
The indifferent
God shit is grace on me
America the arrogant
The belligerent
Will live in infamy
We the people, for no people
Secure the blessings of tragedy
Do or don't we have established
The scar spangled banner

We pledge allegiance to no god
Only to the blood
Liberty is just a dream
When dying in the mud
This, the land of the deceived, home of the depraved
Bombs, they drop like falling leaves
And the deadly flag still waves

[Chorus]

Red the beautiful color of blood
Flowing like a stream
White the color of bleaching bone
Lovely and obscene
Blue the bruising color of flesh
Battered, ripped and torn
The colors of the flag of hate
Of violence and porn
What you see is what you get
You haven't see the bloody trail yet
I'm no patriot, just a hate-triot

Blood sport, my sure bet
See the flag, get a body bag
Salvation form a .44 mag.
Nothing left, no one saved
'Cause our goddamn motherfucking bloody ass
Banner still waves"

Svegliati vieni qua fra le mie mani, nasce il sole
Non pensare al passato, quanta nebbia see'e' la'
Stringimi e parlami ancora, e vedrai si rivivra'

Legami con I capelli il cuore
Tu mia onda scendi dentro me
Stringimi che ormai io sono il mare
Questo brivido ti sciogliera'

Parlami, abbracciami, scivola, azzurra luna
Foglie e il viento ci porta, siamo ali verso il blu
Stringimi e lasciate andare, il mio viento ora sei tu

Legami con I capelli il cuore
Tu mia onda scendi dentro me
Stringimi che ormai noi siamo il mare
Questo brivido ti sciolgera'

E le notti fuggono, Scivolo baciandoti
Mille lune, mille onde, che attraversano il nostro mare
Legami con I capelli il cuore questo brivido ti sciogliera'

Exodus,Low Rider,"All my friends
Own a low rider
Low rider
Is a little higher

Take a little trip with me"
Exodus,El Shaddaii,"There is a joy in the journey,
There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?"
Exodus,Shimmer,"Sharing with us what he knows
Shining eyes are big and blue
And all around him water flows
This world to him is new
This world to him is new
To touch a face
To kiss a smile
New eyes see no race
The essence of a child
The essence
He's born to shimmer, he's born to shine
He's born to radiate
He's born to live, he's born to love
But we'll teach him not to hate
True love it is a rock
Smoothed over by a stream
No ticking of a clock
Truly measures what that means
Truly measures what that means
And this thing they call our time
Heard a brilliant woman say
She said you know it's crazy
How I want to try to capture mine
I think I love this woman's way
I think I love this woman's way she shimmers, the way she shines
The way she radiates
The way she lives, the way she loves
The way she never hates
Sometimes I think of all of this that can surround me
I know it all as being mine
But she kisses me and wraps herself around me
She gives me love, she gives me time
And I feel fine I feel fine
But time I cannot change
So here's to looking back
You know I drink a whole bottle of my pride
And I toast to change to keep these demons off my back
Just get these demons off my back
'Cause I want to shimmer, I want to shine
I want to radiate
I want to live, I want to love
I want to try to learn not to hate
Try not to hate
We're born to shimmer, we're born to shine
We're born to radiate
We're born to live, we're born to love
We're born to never hate"
Exodus,Thorn in My Side,"You know that you never gave me a chance to prove myself
And I never thought that my life was worth your wealth
You never said to me anything encouraging that I could see
It's difficult to cure the pain that I've had to endure

I always tried to listen
Even when I disagreed with you
Selfish disposition makes it hard
For me to respect anything you do
Then you tried to push me,
But you weren't strong enough to get the job done
Then you tried to hit me,
But the back of your hand just isn't quick enough

You are a thorn in my side,
All my life you never left me alone
Thorn in my side, in your mind you wish I never were born
Thorn in my side, through it all I think you pushed me to fail
Thorn in my side, it's about time you're recognized
For your lies and your worthless alibis

It's been a long time waiting for the judgment day
So I can cast away
The thorn that you stuck so deep inside of me
It's ancient history
You're always acting like a king of kings
Like you were a god
You wear a crown of thorns like a hat on your head
My firing squad will put an end to your facade
Like a thorn in my side



"
Exodus,Bitch,"I'm feeling so tired can't understand it
Just had a fortnight sleep
I'm feeling so tired, oh, so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
Feeling hungry can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating faster than a big bass drum

Yeah you got to mix it child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch
You got to mix it child
You got to fix it must be love
It's a bitch

Sometimes I'm sexy, move like a stud
Kicking the stalls all night
Sometimes I'm so shy, got to be worked on
Don't have no bark or no bite"
Exodus,Count Your Blessings,"Power fortune and fame
Only a delusion inside your brain
But those who got it all
Fuckin' piss me off they got a lot of balls
To sit there and complain
That affluence is a tremendous strain
Use some common sense
Take nothing for granted, not a fucking cent

A word to the wise, you should realize
If you don't count your blessings, you're in for a surprise
That you got it so hard, but life dealt you all the cards
You better count your blessings, you better let down your guard
A word to the wise, when will you realize
If you don't count your blessings, you're in for a surprise
The roles will be reversed, and you won't be the first
To wish he counted his blessings

Substantial amounts
Of their money lies in Swiss bank accounts
And more in stocks and bonds
They should consider if it were gone
Just what the hell they'd do
They might have to work to pay for their food
Like every one of us
They'll count their blessings without a fuss

Power fortune and fame
Only a delusion inside your brain
But those who got it all
Fuckin' piss me off they got a lot of balls
To sit there and complain
That affluence is a tremendous strain
Use some common sense
Take nothing for granted, not a fucking cent



"
Exodus,When It Rains It Pours,"Got out of bed about 3 PM thought it was a holiday
Then my boss called just to tell me
I'm late and he's giving my job away
Well I took me a walk to the liquor store
So I could drink away my blues
Spent my last ten bucks, then I dropped the bottle
And I broke it all over my shoes
So I got home to find the power's shut off,
There was someone knocking at my door
It was my landlord serving an eviction notice
'Cause my checks are bouncing off the floor
I pounded my head up against the wall
Thinking what else could go wrong
But this was only the beginning to a real bad day,
It wasn't gonna be a lot of fun

I knew I should have never gotten out of bed
'Cause of the rain cloud above my head
I'm down on my luck and it's plain to see
So tell me why does this happen to me?

When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours on me
When it rains it pours, and there's a storm moving in on me
When it rains it pours, raining down on only me
When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours

I drove across town to go see a friend
When I heard a siren on my tail
It turned out I had a warrant for my arrest
And I couldn't even post the bail
So I'm sittin' in a cell for 48 hours
Keepin' company with thieves and drunks
I'm free to go but my car's impounded
And I'm thinkin' 'bout becoming a monk
So I'm wandering around in a catatonic daze
Now barely a shell of a man
I look like I live out of a shopping cart
And I'm picking up aluminum cans
I staggered my way to an overpass
And fell to the dirt asleep
I figured out tomorrow is a new day
And maybe I could buy myself a life real cheap"
Exodus,Pump It Up,"I've been on tender-hooks ending in dirty looks
Listening to the muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that
She says that's that, I don't want to chitter chat
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat
Pump it up when you don't really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it

Down in the pleasure center, hell bent or heaven sent
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing under hand that she wouldn't understand
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
You want to torture her, you want to talk to her
All the things you bought for her,
could not get her temperature
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission, hit and run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it"
Exodus,Overdose,"I never smoked with no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me something I never had
Pulled me down with you
Pulled me up, think I'm in love
Hope you can pull me through

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Oh woman you give to me
More than I can take
But listen honey, I don't mind
You're a habit I don't want to break
Don't want none of that hard stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in love, and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

Gee I was happy as a man could be
To far gone to escape
Power of love, don't pull me off
Just write on my grave:"
Exodus,'Till Death Do Us Part,"There's some that say we won't last
Say that we could never beat the the odds
But we just look at them and laugh
As the pressure surges through our heads so strong
The heavy side of life
Keeps us going day by day
Our enemies we won't forgive
Condemn them to a life of pain

[Chorus]
Can't you guess what this has done to us?
It gave us power! It's a way of life!
There's no separation
Total annihilation
Crushing through creation
'Til death do us part!

Gathered crushing force of one
Eluding all the basic obstacles
But we're all in this game for fun
So say f*ck off to your politics!
We write the songs we want
And spell it out the way it is
Our music is not a front
It's all about the way we live!

[Chorus]"
Exodus,Objection Overruled,"All rise and come to order
Bailiff start the video recorder
You've been sworn, what's your
Complaint?
Speak up son, don't hesitate!
He presided in his courtroom so long ago
He was hanging cowboys for stealing
Buffalo
Court is adjourned, for his honor's
Feeling ill
The shaking old relic needs a glycerin pill!
Hang up your rope 'cause you're
Looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail
It's TV hell!

Believe it or not
Those walking blood clots
Make enough money for a thousand
Foot yacht
Who in Hollywood
Did they every acquit?
Just senile, judicial idiots
As the drama unfolds
And the law he upholds
If you look real close
You could see him growing mold
Small claims messiah
Is only a pariah to be ridiculed
Objection Overruled!

All rise as he takes the bench
To hear his old voice make my
Gut wrench
Silence to those who are in his court
I'm found guilty by his report
No washed-up judge can say to me
The shit he throws around when
He's on TV
What can he fucking do, throw me in jail?
I'd slap out his dentures, post them
For bail!
Hang up your robe 'cause you're
Looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail, it's TV hell!

You lose the case
To a bigger bullshit they you today
When it comes to the end
You tell all of TV land what you've
Got to say
When you're dead and gone
Will they get another fossil to carry on?
They must go to school
To hand-pick these old fools
I say to you
Objection Overruled!
It's all Perry Mason's fault!
Cat strangling"
Devo,Whip It,"Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your mama's back
 
When a problem comes along 
You must whip it 
Before the cream sits out too long 
You must whip it
When something's going wrong 
You must whip it
 
Now whip it
Into shape 
Shape it up 
Get straight 
Go forward 
Move ahead
Try to detect it

It's not too late 
To whip it
Whip it good
 
When a good time turns around 
You must whip it
You will never live it down 
Unless you whip it
No one gets away 
Until they whip it

I say whip it 
Whip it good
I say whip it 
Whip it good
 
Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your mama's back
 
When a problem comes along 
You must whip it 
Before the cream sits out too long 
You must whip it
When something's going wrong 
You must whip it
 
Now whip it
Into shape 
Shape it up 
Get straight 
Go forward 
Move ahead

It's not too late 
To whip it

The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran

I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away

Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares

Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?

Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

I'm trying to break all connections
Burning a hole in my heart
Trying to transfer affection
Is starting to tear me apart

Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide
Nothing inside

The day that David died
The world stood still
The stars refused to shine
And now he's far away from love
That was his only crime

The spirit moves tonight
To make your young heart
Make your young heart shine
The words he said to us
I'll carry with me for all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the question?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
The world keeps on turning
The world keeps on turning
The world keeps on turning?"

A Flock of Seagulls,Modern Love Is Automatic,"She's an automatic
He's a cosmic man
They will get together
They should know better by now

The meet in a garden
Down in old japan
Where young love's forbidden
You've got to keep it hidden

Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic

Modern love is automatic
Modern love is automatic

They locked him away
For twenty years they say
You won't see him again
But I know diff'rent

A Flock of Seagulls,Rainfall,"Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
 Like crystal teardrops to the floor
 It's even raining in my heart
 I'll close my eyes and let it pour
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls
 And in the darkness of the night
 A trace was left by your perfume
 The only thing you couldn't take
 Are the golden memories of you
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls
 Across an ocean wide a voice that calls your name
 A love that never dies like an eternal flame
 Across the great divide for all eternity
 Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine
 Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
 But now the sun shines high above
 And I won't miss you anymore
 Cause I've found another love
 Now see how the rain falls
 Now see how the rain falls"

I never thought I'd meet a girl like you.

The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through.

A beam of light comes shining down on you. 
Shining down on you. 

The cloud is moving nearer still. 
Aurora borealis comes in view.

I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the make up and
It's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

If I had a photograph of you
It's something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do
It must be something more

Tell me is it all for nothing
Just don't walk out the door

A Flock of Seagulls,Never Again (The Dancer),"I walked alone through the city streets
I hear the shadows calling my name
Lost in the glow of the neon lights
My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

Dancing alone under the cloudy moon
Feeling the rhythm, feeling the heat
No one can see all the tears I cried
Dancing alone, lost to the beat

My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again for the dancer
I am the dancer
I'm the dancer
I am the dancer

Dancing alone here in this crowded room
Millions of faces, but no one I see
Dancing alone, the shadows call too soon
My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

I'm just a dancer, wo oh, wo oh oh
I'm just a dancer who needs more, wo oh
I'm dancing in and out of time
You keep me waiting on the line, wo oh
I am the dancer

My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

I'm just a dancer, wo oh, wo oh oh

I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
All over my head

I was searching for a treasure
Walking on the surface of the Moon

Left me gasping
For the precious air that's over my head 
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in

Saw my reflection in the mirror
Saw my image standing by a wall
I tried to touch the glass
But it shattered and it began to fall
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in 
Over my head
I think I'm in

Another starving baby's cry
A dying heart that's still made bold
Another coke another lie
A naked man I stand alone
Searching for the easy answer
Searching for a love that has no pain
Under the circumstances
The walls of love caved in again
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in 
Over my head

Where the hell have you been? 
I've been watching I've been waiting 
Six times I've read this magazine 
Looking out the window walking down the long and lonely road 
Is there something happening is there something that I should know 
Should I stay should I go 

It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 

Oh baby we should talk it over 
Maybe we can work it out 
I haven't really got an answer 
So tell me what do I do now 

It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 
It's alright when you say you love me 

Standing up on the fourteenth floor 
Looking at the dirty street below 
I've been hanging out for years 
Thinking it's time I let you go 
So go on your way 
This is the end"

Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

What happened to the wings that used to search the sky?
Where did the clouds all fly?
No sign of life around me, nothing anywhere.
This moment I should share.

Moving towards my sight.

No matter how I try.

A Flock of Seagulls,The Story of a Young Heart,"This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
It only seems like yesterday
We were walking in the rain
It only seems that our own soul
Since I looked into your soul
Is tearing me apart
To tell the story of the young heart
The story of the young heart
It only seems that we got to say
Maybe it's been near two years
Since we were burning down the days
Neither happiness nor tears
The story in your eyes
Is the story of the young heart
The story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart (this is the story)
This is the story of the young heart
You know they gotta break your young heart (this is the story)
This is the story of the young heart"
A Flock of Seagulls,Space Age Love Song [Günter Schülz of Kmfdm Remix],"I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And they touched my mind
Although it took a while
I was falling in love
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes)
And you made me cry (and you made me cry, and you made me cry)
And for a little while (a little while, a little while)
I was falling in love

I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love"

A Flock of Seagulls,Ordinary Man,"Wasting your life away in a factory
Doesn't make it right
There's a price to pay for what you need
So you better start to fight
You have the eyes to see what's going down
But you can tell if it's a lie
If you had the power to change this world around
Would the innocent still die
But I'm just an ordinary man
I'm doing everything I can
I just want to raise my family
I'm just an ordinary man
Are you blinded by what you see on the TV screen
To the devils and their plans
Does the blood of a dying man
Or a starving child wash right off your hands
But I'm just an ordinary man
I'm doing everything I can
I just want to raise my family
Yes I'm just an ordinary guy
And I'm not reaching for the sky
It don't make no difference to me
But I'm just an ordinary man
I just want to raise my family
Yes I'm just an ordinary guy
And I'm not reaching for the sky
It don't make no difference you see
Cause I'm just an ordinary man
Something you'll never understand
Why can't you just let me be
I'm just an ordinary man"

Free from all the harm

I will never make you cry
Never leave you or desert you
You know why

I'd like to take you
Although I'm far away
You know I love you
For this, forever and one day

Never leave you or desert you

A Flock of Seagulls,Walking in the Garden,"Somewhere down in new york town
Where lives a friend of mine
But I haven't seen her face
For a very long long time
She tried to tell me that my life was getting harder
She took me by the hand
We went walking in the garden
Well it's five past three in the afternoon
And the sun is burning down
I've gotta pack my bags
And get outta this sticking town
Don't try to tell me that my life is getting harder
When it's seems so easy
Just like walking in the garden
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
And half the world goes dark
We find ourselves alone
Wandering through central park
Don't try to tell me that my life is getting harder
Lay down beside me
We'll go walking in the garden"

I close my eyes and think of you a million miles  away.
I pray you'll be tomorrow and where we were yesterday.

I'd like to see you and I'd like to meet you is this thing so absurd?

Oh take a look at my window
Oh take a look at my window

I stare out of my window at the empty street below
Behind a sheet of pretty glass I've nowhere else to go.

And even true love turns to pain

I look up at the sky so blue
I wonder why I never hear from you

Committed

Committed
There's a hole in your head

Makes me wish I was dead
Every day I exercise
In a yard with a big high wall 
There's a man with a nice green coat

He gets his pencils and he makes a note
And I'm committed
There's a hole in the wall

A Flock of Seagulls,It's Not Me Talking,"I hear voices but there's no one there,
You speak to me in another language.
Computer says it's a binary code,
It's such a pity I can't understand it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

I see a ship from a golden sky,
I sent a message. Will they understand it?
Computer's ready but to overload,
This isn't happening the way I planned it.

It's not me talking,

It's not me talking,

Another being from another planet.

Another galaxy, another planet.

A Flock of Seagulls,I Ran (So Far Away) [Live][*],"I walked along the avenue.
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you;
Meet a girl like you.
With auburn hair and tawny eyes;
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through;
Hypnotize me through.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away.

A cloud appears above your head;
A beam of light comes shining down on you,
Shining down on you.
The cloud is moving nearer still.
Aurora borealis comes in view;
Aurora comes in view.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away.

Reached out a hand to touch your face;
You're slowly disappearing from my view;
Disappearing from my view.
Reached out a hand to try again;
I'm floating in a beam of light with you;
A beam of light with you.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away."

It's sixty five on a one way street

Now I've got a brick for your window

Highrise hogwash dealt to freeze dried stares
Talk 's expensive listening nobody cares
Cram those bank account's stocks and shares

Now I've got a brick for your window
Now I've got a brick for your window

When individualism dies
Everything's the same
You can kiss my ass to the state machine! 

Good versus evil's such a bogus plot
Things aren't what they seem
I've got a seven and a half for your tv screen! 

Herds of paper eaters licking feet
Static babble now it's starting to tweak
Company kept is just a flock of creeps
Alienate me now I feel like a freak

Now I've got a brick for your window
Yeah! I've got a brick for your window

Good versus evil's such a bogus plot
Things aren't what they seem
Now I've got a seven and a half for your tv screen! !"
Circle Jerks,Fable,"Sunshine visits our new now world
Dogcatchers clock out, counterfeiters pray
Pilgrims stranded on an asphalt artery
Without black fluid or a power source, caught chicken pox with measles on a breeze 
Some call him history

Purchased printed slips to a nightmare
Hostess strips on a donkey's back
Where every paths unfinished bridges
Now all our rubber's growing flat

We're looking, searching for the witness on a deal where they bartered over aversion
Any descriptions or whereabouts of a character dressed in grey
Spill these words,big payoff! And for his habit, a statue made of hay
Winning draws a reward,humanity gets saved!

Purchased printed slips to a nightmare
Hostess strips on a donkey's back
Every paths unfinished bridges
Now rubber's growing flat

Well timed frauds want to know who's stomping on their toys in their empirical playpen
Where'd they stash the virgins?

To them it doesn't matter, If there's a silver lining
So what's the difference 
If you haven't washed behind your ears?

Shadow length leeches need their cut of the mold as clumsy martyrs fall over potholes
Lining sidewalks to an early grave
Feminist pillhead crosses her legs
With a dozen extra large a a a eggs
Unfolds a map set in her lap to a grimy universe

Lavender and silhouetted horizon
Nut museum's is dining and dashing
Roses growing backwards
As I gaze down at the feeding site!
I'm a helpless romantic, sunk neck deep in quicksand
I'll keep reaching with magnetic eyes"
Circle Jerks,Grey Life,"Wilting flowers equate death
Not what I'm about
This war of wits like Vietnam

I need a lump of something
So confused what i want
To put it down in layman's terms
I'm basically fucked
Could have given everything
But that's not enough
When i asked for sugar
You substitute salt

I'm trying to think up
Some miraculous strategy
To bust loose from this creeping misery

I won't settle for a gray life
I won't settle for a gray life
I won't settle for a gray life

Sawing on my limbs
In this surrealistic dream
Tie me up, gag my mouth
Now i 'm ready to scream
Sad eyed velvet painting
You don't want to be loved
Titanic front row state room
You've been screwing the crew
I might be an imbecile
But i won't be a fool

I'm trying to think up
Some miraculous strategy
To bust loose from this creeping misery

I won't settle on a gray life
I won't settle on a gray life
I won't settle on a gray life

I need a lump of something
So confused what i want
To put it down in layman's terms

Clean that cage, make your bed
No remorse for those things you did
Hatching schemes beneath those ribs

Grades so poor she'll barely pass
Oldest roger he's so dear

There's not much to do to save them
Tell yourself you'll spend more time
With the kids they'll say forget it

Stop to watch, stand and stare

Go let them in, there are our friends
As long as they play Monopoly
Nothing to hide, set up the scene

Heading a false reality
We need a hype, got a hype
If we believe in what they say
Closer to me, rather behind

It don't seem so far away
Watch your mouth on mindless beach
Be your best, stay on your feet
Cry to so when you weep

Why are they always hounding me?
Why? Tell me why?
Brother's crying, sons are dying
Sounds of weapons, bullets flying

Never giving always taking
Filled with lies, always faking
Never carry, never shake
Always rough and overbearing

Why do you want to fight with me?
Tell me why, tell me why
Sell them tractors, give them seeds
Help them boost their economy

Let them up and hear their pleads
Mind your own, just set them free

Filled with gloom all the walking trash

What's good for our children
Put prayer back in the school
Make it right make it right

Right out of your mouth
Its OK your buying salvation
Fly that Lear Jet across the nation

I'm living in the USA and I don't care
Buy it, sell it, commercialize it

Of the statue of liberty
Sell your beer, soft drinks and cars
That's the American way

They can justify anything they do
It's alright, as long as their waving

And it kills me to treat you this way

Each day we rise with the sun in our room
Needles and pills lead us right to our doom, right to our doom
Looking like the tail end of a hurricane
Death warmed over the rear end of destruction, rear end of destruction

It used to be pretty
But it's just getting ugly
Cause your getting caught up in a loosing race
You're drowning in a sea of drugs
They pulled out the carpet
Look at everything you've taken
What have you done

The distance grows, you're fading away 
Disturbed since birth
No way to control you
You took a vow to love me forever
Never say you're sorry

The arms that they have sold
Half the world can't get a meal
The war is getting cold

To dominate your crave

See the boredom in their eyes

She's the town whore, the village star
Who'll be the one to get up her dress?

Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the skies

So they sprinkled angel dust in your hair
Golden starlight in your eyes, ooh

I find my baby, gotta hold her tight
Gotta grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been ""when it's right, it's right""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Having my baby

Singin' a song
Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong
Stop (stop!) I really love you
Stop (stop!) I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're holding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Becomes final today

Will be going away
But I love you both, and this will be pure H-E-double-L on me

I cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun?
Here's my head!

Let's go to the Hong Kong
Breaking glass at madame Wong's.
Let's go buy a pint of booze
Getting drunk getting loose

Seven nights seven 'ludes
What's the deal with this band?
Let's go roll some fields,

Then they'll go upstairs and go to bed"

Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin
thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't want to see me stackin G's
They after a playa but I won't let em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine 
I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down the four-five beware of stangers 
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me 
before the penitentiary 
Let's get it on!!

I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!"" 
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps 
and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody want to see 
but them youth don't trouble we 
because they fall victim to what they see hey! 
I keeps it +Reel to Reel+ like my last album title song 
but I understand it takes a year for niggaz to catch on

Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to 
get wicked in the joint uh Notorious is glorious

Niggaz now who's the mind blower, the weed grower 
Have you seeing doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower 
B.I.G. top notch with the glock check your pockets 
and your sock it's just the way my pops taught me 
When you throw the drop check em thoroughly 
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight
Reminiscin on my swingin days 
when I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yea she had the Gucci boots I had Sarducci suits
Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin Bucktown
Mac-11 cocked back niggaz better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it on"
Heavy D,It,"[Chorus]
It was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more
And it was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more

Well did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh 
Is not the ending to life fear not of the Anti-Christ

Did you know that I exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear Jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls

Your bodies just a vehicle transporting the soul
It's what's inside people, is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil, every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

[Chorus]

It is told that once this greasy order
Is form it comes into a young man's world
And two of dem is like a soldier
That joins the thunder is a wonder

One's attack is like a blunder
One is luckily a stranger
Dem both was born like Jesus inna manger
So join the thunder that's savin' our world

A vester on his chest and Rastafarian is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got, lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not, do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames, same blood that runs through my veins

Watch for sticks and stones stumbling blocks and piles
Life is one big road miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
And most people don't even smile there's a natural mystic

Blowing in through the air so keep it realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and clear, 
But most people won't even hear spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

[Chorus]"

Black coffee got the flip like a mitten
Roars like a lion and when I stroke her kitten
Versatile when the coke gets mine
She got a positive style ain't had none in a while

Party animal but Biggie only when she with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about, hey

Fancy here, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip
A closet full of gear so you know she stay [unverified]

Body so smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some old sex potion
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I want it, yeah, my black coffee

Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team

Black coffee, the African queen
Part of [unverified] Afro-American dream
Enough respect, I'm diggin' intellect
Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step

The backbone of the black bone here's to ya
As long as I'm around believe me none could ever do ya
You warm, considerate and far from a softie
And that's why I love ya, you're my black coffee

Black coffee, no sugar, no cream

(Hey!) everybody, shake your body
We don't ill, we chill at a party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable, the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be alarmed but I'm sewing up the resident
With my particular style-style, particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing up lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-cola with it
Doing very well 'cause I took the right road to this
Path
Maker, undertaker, record breaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'ma end it with a bang (yo)

(Hey!) picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Meanwhile I'm lampin', feelin' like a champ and
Push up on a cutie, phone digits I'm stampin'
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumpin' in stereo
People said, ""Here we go""
A cutie down in front said
""Heavy, you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
There's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Love is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Flipping on the mic makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, 'cause you couldn't even hang (yo)
We got our own thang

Heavy D,Vivir Sin Ti,"Ha ha, yeah, Big Bub, nine seven
Yo, Latifah, do you...

[Queen Latifah]
We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously 
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face, and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus; tell 'em we're twin porche's

[Big Bub]
Girl, I am diggin' you
You're diggin' me
Let's make this happen
The things I want to do to you 
Your mind just can't imagine
I want to show you bigger faces
Take you different places
I need you in my life 
So, baby, won't you be my lady?

[Big Bub]
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
I need you with me
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
Oh, baby

I'm on another level
Can't you see that I'm no player?
Meet your desires
Take you higher like an elevator
And here's the bottom line
No one can ever love you better
If you like what you're hearing 
Girl, let's get together

I want your love (oh yeah)
I need your love
I need you with me
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
I'll give a million dollars to have you, babe

I want your love (oh yeah)
I need your love 
Heavy, heavy, heavy, yeah

[Heavy D]
Hey yo, boo
You take some time and vibe with me
Now jump in the car and ride with me
She said: ""water bed, I like when you inside of me.""
'Cause you belly all big, and you so fly to me
Now shorty takes trips and various whips
Her phone flips; likes style lavish
Playin' the cabin
Word the mother 
That's my nigga, Big Bub
I want your love
I need your love

Whoa baby, yeah

Heavy D,Alright,"Can I take a moment to tell you how I feel?
These words are not just lyrics, no, but they're oh so real
Let me tell you a story that happens everyday
How my Lord, He keeps making a way

Won't He make everything alright
Won't He make everything alright
Alright, alright, alright
He'll make it alright

Me and my wife tried to have a child
But all the doctors in town they just counted us out
It's been eight years in the making and I'm glad to say
I got me a little girl and another one on the way

He'll make it alright
From the mountain
In the valley low
I'll tell the world
Everywhere that I go
He'll make it alright
He'll make it alright"
Heavy D,Rock with You,"[Heavy D.] (Brandy)

Smooth criminals
Ooh wee we lovable, huggable, snuggable
DFC
H to the E to the A to the V to the Y
Brandy sweet like candy, get fly

[Brandy]
Boy, close your eyes
Let the rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do, oh oh

Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with my mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

Chorus:
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Dance you into day ('til the sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Rock the night away

[Brandy]
Boy, out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Boy, when you dance, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love, oh oooh

Just take it slow, uh
We got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

Chorus

[Brandy]
And when the groove is dead and gone (dead and gone)
You know that love survives
And we can rock forever, oh whoa oh

[Heavy D.]
Overseas trashin'
My passion for Hip Hop
?
I clock dollas and a rip spot
Make moves, smooth do's like Q
Attract fly honeys with exotic
? and money
I can make it hotter
?
Freshman, so don't test me
You go 1, 2, 3 and B's in da house
And I'm out

[Chorus]"
Heavy D,Don't You Know,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say cuff
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya' know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha
Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum diddly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So I blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)"
Heavy D,Chunky but Funky,"Poetically inclined, put in good order
I keep a party filled like a bucket of water
When Heavy's in the house, all the girls go crazy
Fellas that are jealous say, ""Man, you amaze me!""
But all you need is the secret I keep
You grab a girl, gain some weight so she can squeeze the beat
Say ""Hey good lookin"" with the sweetest position
""Get inside the car so I can crank the ignition
You got some trouble, I handle him fo' ya
We cruise around in my BMW""
You got to have the voice to make the people jumpy
I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from three
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin', The Boyz are hop-hippin'
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin'
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin' till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin' all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin' party people performer
Cold gettin' paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide 
From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin'
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin' and rhymin', flyin' and climbin'
To the top where stars are shinin'
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin' is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?) 
I'm chunky but funky

(He's chunky but funky)"
Heavy D,Chunky but Funky [Remix],"Poetically inclined, put in good order

I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from three
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin', The Boyz are hop-hippin'
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin'
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin' till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin' all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin' party people performer
Cold gettin' paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide 
From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin'
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin' and rhymin', flyin' and climbin'
To the top where stars are shinin'
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin' is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?) 
I'm chunky but funky

(He's chunky but funky)"

Heavy D,Somebody for Me,"Love somebody

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

I'll search low and I'll search high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
My destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again

They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debating and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
Nothing

It seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?

I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never find
They also say that love is blind

It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me for me

(I know you want love)
Love, that's what I'm talkin' about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for

(Maybe if you take your time)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Yo, Eddie F. break it down

Yeah, aight, here we go
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber

I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
'Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me"

Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip

Heavy D,On Point,"Yeah, yeah, Eightball, the Fat Mack in the house

Big Pun up in here, you know what I'm talking about
Heavy D, Fat Mack, we gonna do this
You know what I'm talking about
Sure, poor, blower, this how we do, Heavy D, set it up

Big Gentlemen, asshole full of Benjamins
New millennium, new Bentley then a sort addition
Gorgeous women, swimming in 'em
Cinnamon with denim, diva pigeons, peep the glissin'
Y'all don't listen, see, what you missin'

Diggy, double shot a Henny
All about the ammo N E why, bubble like no any
Diamond lipped, crucifix, seducing chicks
Selective whips, consecutive hits

I break sun with Pun, crew hall with Ball
Screw all of y'all, we the big shots
Heavy rotation, every location
Smoke stogies with roadies
On the corner in front of Bodega's

World famous, you gon' love us or hate us
You the type that'd scuff up my gators
Because of my papers been about my glitter
So you killin' my jaw
Damn, can't a nigga live, homeboy?

Days and days, blazing green shades of sticky haze
Remember Eightball from doin' it the player way
Turn it up and we gon' rock it 'till the track stops
Make the club seem hotter than a crack spot

Players pushin' poetry like it's a kilo
Keep my jewelry froze like my name's Sub Zero
Pimp 'till I'm gone, thug, living ain't new to me
Love me a ghetto girl and everything she do to me

Presidential suites and Bezo's turn 'em out
Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out
How you lovin' that icin' on the cake right
Miami girls hit that white and shake it all night

Slab riders, chrome twinkies smokin' sticky, iced pinky
With some styles flipping with me
Memphis, let me break it down for you, pal
Makin' easy money pimping hoes in style

From the middle of Little Italy
With Eightball and Heavy
Diddly diddly diddly dee

It's no surprise how we pulverize
All you smaller guys
Fronting that you live but we oversize

Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best

Take time to perfect every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
No time for them chicks
They be tryin' to resist, every time I insist
They submit, bitch, don't be lying on my prick

I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Would you rise in my direction?
If you strive for perfection
And just watch the pro but it's like a chore

You gotta cap and go feelin' for more
Catch me next time, I gotta rock a show
Gots to go, I'll be back and some other fat chick
Peace to the Bronx, a mother in this rap shit

Y'all wish y'all could be this, not 'til I die
Pardon me but the Carti' be, all over me
Chicks in Range Rovers, be beggin' to come home with me
Y'all act like y'all can't recognize a player

And wave 'em like you just don't care
And wave 'em like you just don't care

Bet you feelin' it right, same Dwight, same mic
Still classic, only thing changed, new glasses
Oh, and new asses, can't forget dat now
How many many, not any any
Could ever touch D Daddy, got plenty pennies
And you can see D on yo' TV set
With somethin' fabulous draped around his neck
I went from, nuttin' to some'n, frontin' to bluffin'
To havin' fancy vegetables like cabbage and carrots/karats
I went from Timex to Rolex, from no sex to mo' sex
Deep in the game like what? (Like what?)
And everybody know my name like what? (Like what?)
Like what? (Like what?) Like what? (Like what?)
And all the ladies say

[Chorus]

Imagine, Daddy baggy, shorties from beauty pageants
I had 'em braggin', like Heavy tried to talk to me
Whips exquisite, Benz wagon
Chicks do visit, I've been bangin' pretty ones for free
Woo! All up in you, like flu (what?)
And when I pass through you gon' shake yo' ass too
Back, it's the boss with the platinum cross
(Uh-huh uh-huh) Platinum Porsche, I'm goin' platinum of course
Heavy keep you dance (you keep me dancin')
Do Heavy keep you movin' (you keep me movin')
Ain't no, pretendin' in me, shorty bring your fender to me

But I've been doing that these kids is new to that
Come inside my crib all you see is platinum plaques
Keep the gold ones in the back cause I'm ashamed of that
Now I lounge in the sticks dime piece on my hip
And I've been doing that since big stuff in eighty six
Something about you really turned me on and I can't figure you out
Cause everyday I'm thinking about diggin' you out, what's that about?
I got visions of turning you out
Now I ain't like mike I'm simply just Dwight Arington Myers
Got a grip like pliers keep my name of the wires cause my crew is high flyers
And I got more ice and more cream than bryers you want to try us?

[Chorus]
Something about that thang,
That thang that you do,
Keeps me running back,
Running to you baby I can't imagine
Being without ya can't live without ya baby

Have you ever been treated correctly huh?
You should be glad you connected with d, baby you ready?
Imagine this Hennessey, coat back, drop top,
You and me, one on one buckwildin' non-stop
Flourish you with jew-ell rings real-ly
If you tell me that you do love me sincerely
Take the American express and go shopping
Put your coochie in Gucci cause we ball in the night
Call your girls tell them that your flowing with water
And it's sickening cause this tricking is really out of order                
I'll make you fingers glimmer, ill make your entire attire better
All up in ya liver,make your body quiver
Heav digga damn that, gon be the same nigga you understand that?
My main intent, is to pay your rent
And Imma keep you satisfied, until the day I die alright

Nigga, state yo' biz, handle yo' biz

Sip Bailey's in the Bentleys, agua, in the Jaguar

Heinekens with a dimepiece friend

Heavy D,Dancin' in the Night,"Do you ever feel like, gettin' high?
Do you ever feel like, leavin' this world?
Uhh do you ever feel like, you ball by yourself?
Do you ever feel unnecessary? Uh-huh

Don't call me crazy but sometimes I feel like gettin' up
and dancin' in the middle of the night
I need a way to release myself
from all the pain and the pressures in life (one time)
Considered drinkin', but then I started thinkin'
I'd probably drown away my life
Gotta do somethin', too many people frontin'
You see I need a way to get by

[Chorus x2]
That's why I get hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
from dancin' in the middle of the night
Dancin' in the moonlight

Last night I'm cruisin' the Meadows, better known as the ghetto
Seen a shorty named Black
At thirteen he's deep in the drug scene
And there probably ain't no turnin' back
He said dat, momma was smokin', he tired of bein' broke and
poppa locked up and ain't comin' back
I almost cried when he looked in my eyes
and he said he didn't care if he died

[Chorus]

I've been dreamin' for years, cried a river of tears
I can't take it no more
I seen the bible dying
And I don't wanan cry no more (just ain't right)
Too many people pushin' too many people
Hate is just a sequel, cause still nobody's equal
And I find myself lying
'Cause I don't wanna cry no more

[Chorus]

Dancin' in the moonlight
Said dancin' in the moonlight [x7]

[Chorus]

Dancin' in the moonlight
Said dancin' in the moonlight"
Heavy D,Ask Heaven,"I'd like to dedicate this song
To everyone who's cried before
Who's felt pain and suffering before
This just ain't about me
But most importantly I'd like to send this song out to my family
I love my family
'Specially my mother and my father
I wanna thank you for being so strong
God bless you, I love you

Sometimes I sit back, relax, sip on Cognac, reminscin'
on how it used to be, when we were kids
Laughin' at the things that we did (uh-huh)
Damn near broke but we knew how to live, peep the scene
Mom and dad, bustin they ass, fourteen years
In the night they would pass, each other
Tryin' to raise six of us one sister, four brothers
Two deceased, laid to rest
And I miss you cats, what I wouldn't give to bring you back
To fill the void that you left in my heart
Your last breath really tore me apart
And I'm sorry if I never said I loved you enough
I truly did

[Chorus]
Ask, heaven, heaven is there room for me?
Cause I believe, that's where you'll be
Waiting for me, at the end of a stairway to heaven

Aiyyo I swear to you, I'll put it on the bible, no lie
On the days you guys died, I seen daddy cried
I was shocked, y'all know how tough pop is (f'real)
But he really turned soft when life stopped his kids (damn)
Speakin' of kids? Yours - beautiful
Promisin', beautiful, I wish you could see 'em
So much of life, with a touch of yo' light
And I'm doin' my best, to make sure they alright
When I was young, some big kids stole my bike

Came home and told y'all and had it back that night
When I was older you started smokin' and you sold my bike
I remember cause I cried all night; I wasn't mad
I was sad cause the crack had control of your life
And you couldn't even put up a fight
You told me Dwight, I promise lil' brother, I'ma make it alright
You left home, and you died that night - damn I miss you

[Chorus]

Thanksgiving day, came home, surprised the family (surprise)
Walked inside the crib, the mood was wrong (damn)
I heard my moms in the background screamin' on the phone (dad what's goin on?)
I rushed to get closer like yo mom, what's wrong?
She said your brother's buggin' out, hurry up, take a look
I grabbed my brother Floyd and we started to book (run run)
It wouldn't take long, he lived right around the block
I tried to stay strong, but I was shakin' a lot (I'm scared)
Got there, ran up the stairs, he was stretched out in the lobby
A 7-year jail bid physique graced his body
I fell to my knees, like no Jerry please
I was frightened, he was fightin' to breathe
Mumblin' somethin' ""Heav' don't let 'em take me I ain't ready to leave""
I felt his clutch on the cuff of my sleeve, then it eased
He felt calm, as he died in my arms
OD's off of heron, and just like that, he was gone
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, ma you hear me?
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, I love you"
Heavy D,Spanish Fly,"Hola mama (hola papa)
Como estas? (bien y tu?)
Chillin, you look good (you too papi)
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

Yeah, por favor
Right, uhh, yeah, yeah
Check check
Yo, check me, check me, uh - yo

[Chorus]
Such a long way to go, but I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam, but I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly

Right, right, yo, yo
I met her at the Copa, Cabana (how she look?)
Word to mom she bananas, I swear I wanna slam her
Like Tito Santana, can't wait to wrestle her
Curious about the sex in her, Gabbana dress on her
Next to her, this cat champagne sippin', ice drippin'
Roleys on the cuff, but she winked at Big Stuff
""How you doin papa?"" I'm just chillin' mama
Loungin' - ""Smokin' on your Cubana?""
Si, the, first name Heavy
She started rubbin' on my big belly, stay put
I can see how you got these other dames shook
'Cause from the first look, a nigga like Water was hooked
She said the name was Carmelita, boricua, from Puerto Rica
Tu eres, mi amiga, senorita?
Me and you friends baby, me and you friends
""Si somos amigos""

[Chorus]

Hu-huh, yo
You the flyest lady in the house ""true"" hear Heavy out
Wanna make you scream ""uh-huh"" wanna make you shout ""okay""
Let me feel this real, baby we can chill
Week in Brazil, D keep it real ""mmm""
Sleep in the hills, native of the 'Ville
Native of Jamaica, steady makin paper ""aight""
See all the linens be crushed plus the gators
Smoke Cuban, gruff smoke Garcia Vegas and dutches
Did world tours, ten buses ""what""
Live life deluxest, some friends is hustlers
And them the type of cats that will spend ends to touch ya
See me I wanna love ya, just flow with Diggy
And I'm always thinkin' of ya, that's word to Biggie
Let's blow this joint and splurge the city, damn you pretty ""gracias""
And them niggaz over there can't stand you with me
Mamita, um beso, por favor
""Por que?"" Por favor mama, por favor

[Chorus x2]"
Heavy D,I Know You Love Me,"Good evening ladies and gentlemen

Dig it (aowwwwwww!) C'mon

Tell them they can't touch me
You're big and, you're sexy

Runnin' off your mouth in the gamblin' spot
You the type of dude that'll get cats knocked
Snitchin' to cops, you be bitchin' a lot blah blah
Talkin 'bout, Heavy don't keep it real
Well why don'tcha stop tellin', and keep it real in jail
See me? I just play my lane
Baptize my game, fraternize with dames
Diamond lit crucifix, dangle from chains
Simple and plain, I'm handlin' thangs
When it's warm, put my minks in the freezer
Bodyguard, two divas, with the two heaters in the two-seater
Diggy gon' spread like germ
When it's my turn I jiggle my worm, wiggle like sperm
Watch me Bus like Bettis, I got a cheddar fetish
Because I heat up yo' spot, you gon' feel me a lot
H-E, A-V, Y-D
And I'll be damned, if you ain't lovin me, c'mon

I know you love me"

Heavy D,Need Your Love,"Ha ha, yeah, Big Bub, nine seven
Yo, Latifah, do you...

[Queen Latifah]
We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously 
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face, and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus; tell 'em we're twin porche's

[Big Bub]
Girl, I am diggin' you
You're diggin' me
Let's make this happen

Her phone flips; likes style lavish

Or could it be lust that I feel
You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head 
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute 
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I spend quality time 
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feel me creeping to your room late at night

You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign
Boo be all that and then some
Job all that mad income
Hand New Yorkers wish you represent from
24-7 you the one that I be sweating
You and time that's no question couldn't be nothin' less than
Sexually the best next to me I confess
You got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty
Nothin' could compare to you Boo I swear to you 
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you
Might even steal for you 
You walk like talk like sexy
When you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me
You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy"

My previous dames, played devious games
Wanted a piece of my livin', so I dismissed the pigeons
However I stay concurrent with leathers in cold weathers
Forget Batman, I guess it's Fat-man forever (and)
I keep peepin' yo' game, you don't be creepin' the same

From the introduction, you know my funk was all up in ya
Deep in ya creep when you walk, I dig that
Split your wig back, now grab the bedpost
Move in real close, I feel what you doin', true'n
No need no Dom P, no need no Crist'y
All you need is me, Hev D, naturally
Rough rider, ""Mr. Big Stuff,"" up inside her
Multiple provider, the fly divider
Romeo, jiggalo, high-yellow niggaro
From the sound of Mount V., by the way of J-A
I don't play, I insist, on the back twist
Handcuffs and stuff, for those who like it rough
Go 'head baby

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Break it, break it (go 'head baby)
I hear you talkin' mama (go 'head baby)
And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song

Whipped cream dreams I fulfill with my schemes
Down low like R. Kelly, lickin' on yo' belly
Make you shake like jelly, the fat man, battin' a thousand
I play it safe, carry horses just in case
Good to the, last drop da-da
Don't stop is what you tell me, anything to swell me
Private dancin', romancin' the soul
On the telephone you be like ""poppa come home""
Right now I got 30 minutes of foreplay
Thirty minutes of straight sex, nine minutes of rest, now add that up
Mink rugs, bearhugs, hot tubs
Get lifty off the bubs, is what she loves
Go 'head baby

[Chorus] 

Shorty blender, fender bender, back twirler
Boo twister, officially, sexually
I'm Mr. me be always ready, in jacuzzi
Ahh, baby, do me, do me
Fantastic, romantic, none equivalent
To my tactics, get at this, who want it?
Some get champagne, you know how they be trippin'
But the joke really on you boo, cause sippin' keep you strippin'
(Go 'head baby) Now dance for me, keep romancin' me
You got no chance with me, but you want my hands to be
(right here) Say what, and when you want it
(right now) Say what, and where you want it
(right here) Yeah, know why?
'Cause you'll always be singin' this Heavy D song
[Girl] Oooh, right there

And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
I hear you talkin' boo-boo (go 'head baby)
Feel me out y'all (go 'head baby)
And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)

Heavy D,You Can Get It,"[Chorus]
If you want it you can have it
Baby come and get it
I'll be right here waiting for you
(Take your time, everything'll be fine)
If you need it you can get it
Anyway you want it
I'll be right here waiting for you

Uhh, straight off the top, I refuse to stop
Chicks cling when I do my thing I got it locked
Officially, I'm yo' big belly da-ddy
Technically, you don't need to be with nobody but me
Ha-va-na ci-gar, Ja-mai-can ni-gga
6 Benz, Cartier tint lens, what?
I dig yo' steez, knock knees, trunk full
Body all lumped up, lifestyle Trumped up
Platinum blonde, hazel eyes chinky
Diamond on the pinky, skin bronze, you with me?
She, good'n'plenty, Benz E-320
Me, I pull over, drop that red Range Rover
Shorty was milkshake thick, sportin' silk, mink and
She had it sewn, flowin' on her own
She's the type of girl to put her crew on the map
Anything you want, don't wet that, you can get that

[Chorus]

Now let me speak about this chick I call hotter than a flame
Seen her chattin' with this dame, I had to go and get her name
She with her friends, they at the bar gettin' they drinks on
Outfit's off the hook with ice gold links on
Way the skirt is fittin' black, who hittin' that
I'm kickin' game up in my head steadily sittin' back (I feel ya)
Now I'm think in the attempt to attack the
Shorty that I'm lookin' at that's lookin' at me
But soon enough I get my nerve up
{?} passes me a drink as Pretty Lou he sparks the herb up
I'm with my Uptown team, makin' noise
Heavy D, Soul IV Real and Lost Boyz
Now I feel it's time to go and get my try on
And take shorty home that I got my eye on
Anything that you want you can catch that
Like my man said, don't sweat that

[Chorus]

By the way mama
Last night the club was tight, shorty's dead right
But you stood out the most, so I had to play you close
Nuttin' less than, black essence, your presence real strong
Dudes all around you frontin' hard, gettin' they trick on
I ain't mad, I just watch you gas 'em up, then I watch you pass 'em up
Then I step up, now look, you shook
You stuck, what's yo' name, what's yo' digits, what'chu drinkin'
My treat and when they steppin' you get swept up off yo' feet
My mission, first position, backs I twist 'em listen
Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy
The all-star, dapper rapper
In conjunction with the funk that keep it blazin' out they trunks
What'chu want, sky's the limit, I live it, now is you wit it
Slow flow, Poconos style, I mean I'm chillin'
Top billin', anything you want, anything you need
Don't wet that boo, you can get that true

[Chorus]"
Heavy D,I'll Do Anything,"Baby, I've got many problems
But my momma won't help me solve them
So I come to you (you you)
But your ass don't wanna be bothered
So I come around don't wanna be bothered
So I come around trying to be down
But you're acting like a silly clown
Ask me for $50
Said to myself
Well I'll be damned
Why are you trying to give me such a very very hard time
When I spend the money on you
You can't get a little of the bump and grind
There must be another man (man), holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me
Baby, baby
I will

I'm trying to go on without you here in my life
I don't wanna accept the fact that your no longer mine
Just to know there's somebody else who's holding and kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like I'm a fool

So girl, I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am

I'm trying to cope with these emotions everyday (day)
I realize it's too late now you're gone away
Is there something that I can do to reassure
That I won't hurt you like this anymore

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am

So I'll do anything, anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done 
I'm sorry, I'm begging you, I'm begging me

I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
That's my word is (that's my word is bond)
Please forgive me (can't you tell, can't you tell by the look in my eye)
I'll do anything 
That's my word is bond (I like that)
Please forgive me (please forgive me I'm sorry) 
Everything I've done
I'm sorry

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am

Heavy D,Don't Be Afraid,"I know it's hard to believe, when your eyes just can't see
So lean on Me, I have not disappeared and I can see you from here
Tears are blinding you from the truth
Oh, I'm right here in front of you

Won't you reach out and take my hand
Don't be afraid of love, don't be afraid of love
I'll know you'll find your strength again
Don't lose your faith, don't be afraid

There are questions on your face with no answers in place
So just believe for tomorrow will come and with it, the morning sun
Oh, I hop you will let me in
That's when the healing begins

There's a wall surrounding you
Love alone can make it through
You're caught up in the circle you drew
And when your world starts tumbling' there for you"

To excite me, it's all about you, then it's all about you

Since you our love child, the stallion of style
You live foul when on the prowl I kidnap the crowd
The raw rough, rugged enough to call bluffs
Ladies try lockin' niggaz down like cuffs

It's off the heezy, girl, I like my hair peasy
(Touch me, tease me)
Girl, take it easy
I hits the spizzy with Heav' Dizzy and Young Daz
You're too young to last wit'cha pretty young ass

Lyrical outlaw, write my rhymes southpaw
Poppin' shit, niggaz get punched in they mouth for

Can you handle it? Can you handle it?
Do you know what you're dealing with?
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?

All the moves you make, e'ry step you take
Get you all alone and bend you 'til you break
Wait then give you back to the cat in the cake

Nah, I ain't a sucker, I'm all about my papes
Just 'cause you caught the vapes and tryin' to hang like drapes
Mess around and get your feelings crushed like grapes
I give it all it takes to shake just like quakes

Herb McGruff, Heav' D, Dogg Pound creation

Turn up your stereos, keep your blunts blazin', amazin'

About money makin', tired of all these clown niggaz fakin'

The Rolex, the lucci, Versace, Coogi, Gucci

Chicks dig me, no question, chicks love me, no doubt
They be all up in my house nigga, now what's that all about?
Here's what I like, 138, that's 69 twice in one night
Who's jiggy, Heav' Diggy, no question

Low pros, chrome rims, Manhattan condominium
Now I imagine scoopin' dime pieces at beauty pageants
Protect your fertible, sex convertible, Lex and Rolex

Content, on how to get G's, I know thieves and criminals
Buff thugs who show love, back rubs from dimes and dub
Hotties with narcotic bodies, my style is urgent
A rap merchant, a major player with flavor

Well it's the H E, you see me, A V why, that be me
The dress code a pain, some things never change, huh

Heavy D,Big Daddy [Remix],"What's the deal
I wanna know is this love for real
Or could it be lust that I feel
You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head 
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute 
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I spend quality time 
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feel me creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right
You be like that its that big man we all up tonight
Game ear tight why you caught up in the hype
That's right that's miggie, miggie, biggie
Baby your ready for big daddy

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign
Boo be all that and then some
Job all that mad income
Hand New Yorkers wish you represent from
24-7 you the one that I be sweating
You and time that's no question couldn't be nothin' less than
Sexually the best next to me I confess
You got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty
Nothin' could compare to you Boo I swear to you 
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you
Might even steal for you 
You walk like talk like sexy
When you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me
You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie 
You could be my big daddy"
Heavy D,Let's Get It On,"[Heavy D] 
Yea this is uh Super funk you know what I'm sayin
This is for all the players and playetts wherever you at you dig
I'm talkin about from this side to that side 
East side, West side, your side, my side
It's all about being funky man
Aiyyo give me that microphone
It's Heavy D the baritone and I'm home alone dig it 
and I'm always staying freshly dipped on 1-2-5th 
where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin spliff
Okay okay okay okay it's Heavy D again
Hallelujah I'm on your T.V. screen again
You see me on your MTV and on your BET 
and on your local focal point video show
Nigga this how it flow so fly like an eagle
No sequels no weed but I get love from all the thugs 
cause they still my people 
I'm dynamic punks panic when they see me
They get all shook up when my mic's hooked up 
Let's get it on! 

[chorus]x2 
Untouchables at your door 
(Let's get it on) 
All you wack rappers hit the floor 

[2pac]
How should I plead forever thuggin on a quest to get G's
Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin
thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't want to see me stackin G's
They after a playa but I won't let em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine 
I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down the four-five beware of stangers 
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me 
before the penitentiary 
Let's get it on!! 

[chorus]x2 
Untouchables at your door 
(Let's get it on) 
All you wack rappers hit the floor 

[Grand Puba]
I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do 
I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!"" 
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps 
and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody want to see 
but them youth don't trouble we 
because they fall victim to what they see hey! 
I keeps it +Reel to Reel+ like my last album title song 
but I understand it takes a year for niggaz to catch on
(hit em in the head dog) So let's get it on! yea 

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to 
get wicked in the joint uh Notorious is glorious 
*cough, cough)*
Niggaz now who's the mind blower, the weed grower 
Have you seeing doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower 
B.I.G. top notch with the glock check your pockets 
and your sock it's just the way my pops taught me 
When you throw the drop check em thoroughly 
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight
Reminiscin on my swingin days 
when I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yea she had the Gucci boots I had Sarducci suits
Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin Bucktown
Mac-11 cocked back niggaz better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it on"
Heavy D,This Is Your Night,"[Intro - Heavy D talking]
Ugh
Hey, heh ha ha
This one goes out to all those who want to do their own thing why'knowI'msayin?
Tonight is dedicated to you
Do what you want to do, have fun
You call the shots, and it's on me ha HA
Here we go
Bring it onni onni onni onni on one

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
Tonight is your night so do what you want to
Grab a girl, grab a guy, say hi, say ho
Throw your hands in the air and let the music flow
Now here we go, once again it's the man with the wings on the double
Got my shovel and I'm diggin for skins
Now everything is alright, nobody's uptight
Could be the lights but all the girls look right
Now I'm coolin in the corner with a cutie named Judy
and a girl named Sheryl, said she been around the world
Went and strolled on her own through the club on a rub-a-dub tip
tryin to snuggle up wit another honeydip
I see my peoples on the dancefloor doin their thing
As I 'gan to sing, believe me it's a black thing
The party's all jumpin, everything is alright
So do what you want to do 'cause it's your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I need the dancefloor stacked with back-to-back blacks
and blunts to get contact, some stunts to get tumtaps
The night is still young, the fun is still fun
Everybody move your body, it ain't nuttin but a party
Folks can I get a ""ho""? (HO)
Ladies can I get a ""oww""? (OWW) so hear me now
It's a regular routine thing where brothers do their thing
It ain't Arsenio, but it's definitely a night thing
The atmosphere is a rap-most-fear
and everybody from nowhere to somewhere is here
So act like you know, and float with the flow
You heard it on stereo, see it on the video
Everybody's workin up a sweat
Even though roughneck is with the roughneck step
The party's all jumpin, everything is right
So do what you want to do 'cause this is your night

	[Chorus - The Boyz]
	Tonight - This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I got the goods and the goodies, some brothers be in hoodies
and some girls be in tight jeans, it's part of the night scene
Everybody is freshly dipped
Brothers be at the bar actin like movie stars, set to flip
The whole crowd's in a good groove, eatin the good food
Soul food to keep you in a good mood
Champagne flowin, people hey-hoin
Time just passed without ya even knowin
Party's like pretty sights, late nights
Flexed from a set to the next set, it's aight
The party's only jumpin, everything is tight
So do what you want because it's your night

		[Chorus - The Boyz] x2
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
		 This is your night
	Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright"
Heavy D,Got Me Waiting [Remix],"Just when I thought I found me someone I can go with just
When I thought I found me someone I can go with that's
When my girl friend came to me, said she told me that nigga
Ain't nothing I seen him in the club, acting like he won't, no

Where around that's when I found out that you was nothing
For me and all the love that you said that you had
It turned out to be funny and I done gave you the best part
I don't know what else I can do to turn you around no

You got me waiting you got me waiting
When I am telling you everything you
Need to hear like baby, come, now you
Got me waiting but I can't keep waiting
On you acting like whatever I will always

Be around 'cause you think that you
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me, ohh baby, now you got me waiting
But I can't keep waiting on you, ohh

Look at me and tell me now if I can be the last one that that
You think about thinking you, can keep running out my life
My life my life why is it's so hard for you to pick up the phone
And call me put a little time in for me to show that you really care for

Me remember how you used to say
That nothing comes before me
You now it was a lie because you put your
Boys before me promises, promises
Made and broken still I keep
Holding on thinking you would that notice that

You got me waiting you got me waiting
When I telling you everything you need
To hear like baby, come, now you got me
Waiting but I can't keeping waiting on you
Acting like whatever I will always be

Around 'cause you think that you're something
Like a pimp and you can hang in these streets
And it will be all right with me but baby, you
Got me waiting and I can't keep waiting on you

There comes a time in every man's life
Where he has to do everything his girl
Likes because if he don't choose to
Play by the rules I am sure there's
Somebody else out there who just would love

Too do me hold me go the extra mile
Like you did when you was trying to
Get to no me do me hold me treat me
Nice and show me all the things you
Forgot to show me 'cause

You got me waiting got me waiting
When I am telling you everything
You need to hear like baby, come
Now you got me waiting but I can't
Keep waiting on you acting like

Whatever 'cause I will always be
Around 'cause you think that you're
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me you got me waiting but I can't keep waiting on you"

Gotta be a dark skin a light skin
Like the type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down
She's my sexy souffle
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work it
If you try to disrespect her face
Around and get her feelings hurt
She ain't ? from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it, a
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight ? from her mack
But she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can

Versatile when the coke gets mine
She got a positive style ain't had none in a while
Party animal but Biggie only when she with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about, hey
Fancy here, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip
A closet full of gear so you know she stay ??
Body so smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some old sex potion

Heavy D,Who's the Man?,"Oh yes this is special
This is direct from what we call The Funk House
This is a total dope phat one, knowhatI'msayin?
And this is how it's done, Uh!

I did good in my hood as a youngster
The Heavster was never a punkster, no sir
No ma'am, hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand
The bigger nigga is back and I'm on the right track
As a matter of fact, I'm all that
So ring around the Rosie, oopsy-daisy
Topsy turvy, you never heard of me you don't deserve me
Fly like Kinievel, drive like a BMW
You never knew I could bring trouble to
a cordless you can't afford this don't get aboard this flavor
Unless you got the fever flavor for a Pringle
Come be a single, let me see you mingle jingle dangle
Sammy Davis Jr. was Mr. Bojangles
(Here is something you can't understand)
Tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man? (The Heavster)
(""Time keeps on slipping"")

Yes, too many brothers be fakin' moves, or frontin' grooves
Peace to all the brothers on the block, drinkin' and passin' brew
Money tried to flip but he got flopped
Said it was his corner let him know his corner's on my block
I know your fantasy, don't Stay, I ain't Jodeci
When I used to juggle y'all was crumbs who didn't notice me
But now you see me in a magazine, on your TV screen
On the radio liver stereo lookin' clean
All of a sudden I'm attractive, I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say you can't afford this
I wreck shops and got props from New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley
Ain't nuttin changed... wait a minute, I'm a liar
The crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two
Who's the man?
Like I said, this here, is official

Back in the day I used to punch clocks now I'm drippin' props
And countin' loot, and shootin' hoops, and lookin' cute
in tailored suits, made for the Over-weight Lover
undercover, over cover
You know my MO I do damn well on the stage show
I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop who's the bigger one, quick to figure one
two, three two one, ah!
Keep a pen and a pad on stash
I used to crab the last, now I flow for dough, and I rhyme for cash
I'm glad to say goodnight to Johnny Carson
And brother where you rub it 'fore you catch the Magic in your Johnson
Honeydips, money grips
I know the difference cause I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Everything here, is phat, knowhatI'msayin?
Don't take it the wrong way, but I'm lettin' you know
For the last time, this here is official
This is fat"

Premier got the butter cuts, here comes that ol' rugged stuff
No room for no pitty-pat, petty kitty-kat rap
I jig em renege em or give em a dug em diggum smack
I seen you hangin on ghetto blocks, tryin to get ghetto props
You need to stop, you're just a ghetto flop
Here comes niggy-nack piggyback, knapsack sacky
Saki, classic like a Kawasaki, rough like Rocky
Sisters call me dadi Puerto Ricans call me papi
You can't stop me
Uhh, 'cause in these times of tough times
I'm coming with rough rhymes
Rugged beats I'm passin' time on satin sheets
And where I came from, some come from
Tryin' to diss the champion, numba one, Don Gargon
Talkin' behind my back like they alla that, they ain't halfa that
Matter of fact, I'm the one who put the town on the map
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

Yeah funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh yeah, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Yeah yes, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

Here comes the bigger bro, I'm on the slow nigga flow
I like to do bigger show, so I can get bigger dough
I hung out in crazy states, sit down and ate crazy steaks
In the morning time I wake up with a rhyme and some Corn Flakes
Rap is a stallion's job, hung out with Italian mobs
I been around the world with pretty girls and they credit cards
Around in the Source van, got paid when my horse ran
And despite the verdict, I'm still a Mike Tyson fan
In the trench I get ruff, on the stretch, I get vexed
Eddie F's on the set who's next to get wrecked
Mr. Sweeperman, time to do the sweep up
Brothers couldn't keep up, spendin' too much time with their feets up
Listen to it, this is how I do it
When I wreck a set rhymes float like fluid
Lord have mercy on those who curse me
You don't appreciate, neither-for you don't deserve me
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick""
Yeah what? Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh talk about it alright yeah
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh yeah, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

[Repeat x8]
So break it down
""So easy does it on the DL, the Heavster""

Didn't it make you sick when I went pop and I kept my props 
and I blew up the spot and was large on your block
I know it did that's why you formed the committee
Of a bunch of itty bitty silly Milli Vanilli hillbilly niggies
never mind all the chitter chat, cause I got a bigger bat
Step out of line again to get your jaw tapped
Don't try to play me for cream puff
Forgot I was big stuff, rough tough, and all that stuff, huh?
You jabber jaw junkie, rap tour flunkie
Quick at the lip, but when you see me you flip like a monkey
It always amazes me, how some brother's faces be
Smilin' but behind your back they talk like an enemy
But I got a sharper blade, from here I see better days
Sittin' on my porch countin' loot drinkin' lemonade
Swingin' with the shy type, girl who's the fly type
The non gettin high type, that's how you know she's my type
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick"""
Heavy D,Yes Y'All,"[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Do it like this though, do it like this though, do it like this though
Make it fat like
DIS, dis, UH, uh, HEH, heh, UH, uh
HEH, heh, UH, uh, HEH, heh, UH, uh

Aiyyo ruff ruff rugged rugged ruff ruff digga Dan
Who's that?  The man, I'ma slam it like Bam-Bam
The big man, the bigger plan, the nigga jams
Quick to figure and I pack Palladium stadium stands
Rugged raw, clear the floor
R&B hardcore plenty more. been on plenty tours
Been in plenty drawers, far from just okey-doke
Not into no hokey-poke, although I may drink a Coke
Hell no I won't smoke no coke
Steady steady but ready for pitty petty
Big and heavy, far from Chevy, so save your gas for Getti
Mic check it, microphone check it
Watch me wreck it; I'm never half steppin'

[Chorus]

Far from a chump, I'm a champ, I get amped
When I run through camps, gimme some plaques on the stamp, HEY
I need a girl who got plenty trunk, who knows I got ghetto funk
Not into blunts but I be on a stunt hunt
Got crazy drama, dramatics, big girls in Bahamas are addicts
So now they cling like static, dig it
I rolled up on some old wonderama type of drama
I'ma, comma, big belly punanny momma harmer
Bag a cute, so NIGHT troops, I'm all about
Two scoops, I cut loose, just me and a few troops
To handle static to me is automatic
I never panic or stall, I'm gigantic so yes, y'all

[Chorus]

Uhh, king of the big boys, bigger boys, don't even matter
Save all the chitter chatter, I make em split and scatter
I keep em goin for blocks, I never ran from cops
I roll with my flock, and get props from dreadlocks
I treat a mic like a bad habit, I grab it I gotta have it
A funky junkie flippin styles is automatic
I freak a beat like a prostitute, I'm always in hot pursuit
I'm tryin to get lots of loot, lots of boots
Do jungle rocks like a hustler moving crack
Like a muscl-er microphone damager handin ya rough like a wrang-ler
Sew up cities with girls of pretty, known for the nitty gritty
My flavor, is major, you're itty bitty

[Chorus]"
Heavy D,A Buncha Niggas,"[Intro/Chorus:]
Who's on the microphone? A BUNCHA NIGGAS! (repeat 3X)
I got my crew so other niggas better leave us alone
[Chorus]
[Third Eye]
The Group Home's down yo, flippin with West and me
Charge a gap quick kid, best believe it G
Oh, I like to flip the script and have a track record
Wreckin it swift, I'm tellin ya to heck with tell to get with the
Crazy hairy thinkin drinkin cripple drunken monkey
Style back alley freaky ass to gas technique
So peak, it's about to get deep, we just kick
Your Third Eye right open don't let your eyeball sleep
The next step is the check, let's tell theses niggas whassup
Cause we get freaky G, no you can't get with me
Save yourself the trouble step back black, and don't even bother
Word to Shop and Swift they get called in like I'm your father
[Chorus]
[Guru]
Aiyyo, it's time for me to flow and get down with this
I'm pullin out my mic, spittin off some rounds to this
I gotta known rep, so son you better slide out
Cause when I'm flippin, I'll be rippin your pride out
So called gangsters play roles like in the movies
Oughta save that, they're way bad, you could never do me
I'm real as they come, I'll beat ya numb with my vocal tones
Words hit like aluminum bats to your dome
No charges against me cause I'm jumpin the law man
A-men, punks should cancel their plans
As the invincible principle Gang, is gettin bigger
Sayin peace to the Heavster rollin with a buncha niggas
[Chorus]
[Biggie Smalls/Notorious B.I.G.]
I bring drama like ya, spit on my momma
Cannibalistic, like that nigga Jeffrey Dahmer
I'ma, head peeler, girl stealer
Coffin sealer, ex-drug dealer, HUHHHHHH!
When I hit you with the blow of death I leave nothin left
I cook you up so quick they call me Biggie Smalls the Chef
My burner's in my left, I'm not the type to fight
I'm blowin up quick like a stick of dynamite
So call nine-one-one, Biggie's got a gun
The gat to your back, I'm smokin everyone
Quick to pack, quick to squeeze on the trigger
Who's in the house? HUHHHHHH! A buncha niggas!
[Chorus]
[Rob-O]
Like yo, beg your pardon, whoa
When I put one to the head nuff funk shit startin
Fine, so I headline for the public
Get mine for my rap subjects
Packed with potential, wisdom versatile elements
To quench your sense, I get down so feel the mental
Rhyme pro I'm Rob-O, the super spectacular
Brown skinned junior from Africa
Blowin up so it's, possible to freak
See the highlight, in fly writing, don't give a [f*ck]
I split when it's through then it's get with the Guinness brew
And give a shoutout to my Uptown crew and still I'm wreckin
[Chorus]
[Heavy D]
Yo, here I go, here I go, here comes the man again gain
Ruff with a pad and pen, so run go tell your friends
It's the big belly babalu boogaloo big, boy
And I got plenty honies there's no need for no sex toy
Free me, slavery, let me go oh no no no
No longer will you treat my beautiful sisters like they're filthy hoes
Never ran from static men to crew get dramatic
And I get crazy respect from crazy crews with automatics
Now push could come to shove because they love the way I flip a skip
And that's what keeps me kinda popular with all the honeydaps
So look at me now, and tell me who is bigger?
When I'm on the block I'm with my flock and I'm rollin with a buncha niggas
[Chorus]
[Busta Rhymes]
Well HELLO HI! HELLO HELLO! How ya doin?!
HI! Hello hi HEY, how ya doin?! Voltronic!
Busta Rhymes comin with the mad ultrasonic
Esophagus to rock it, wreckin niggas need to stop it
You get your style busted that's just what they get for comin
You want some?! Yes I know you want some of the TALENT!
But you can juice up, and em-otionally get wicked
To stick it, in your inner groove watch a nigga kick it
Ohh hah! Yo Bee, Busta Rhymes
Be my niggan, never muggin, only lovin and huggin
My niggas, as we get bigger we come diesel
As masculine figures, L.O.N.S. we gettin thicker with a buncha niggas!
YESS!
[Chorus]2X"
Heavy D,The Basement,"Ah yeah! feel the funk bay-be!
That’s right, this is called the basement!
And my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

From the heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I’m your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my er
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I’m like a mink while you’re soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl
Heavy d’s on this track, lettin' you know there’s no replacement
Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

That’s right, crazy funky
Aw my man
He’s crazy funky, his name is rob-o, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you’ll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, Pete makes beats in the basement
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I’d just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint’s bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the ? 
I hear voices sayin', that’s rob-o’dingo in the basement

Ah ha ha ha! hah yeah! this is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like snoopy, the beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin' raw papes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I’m comin' to town but you just can’t wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin' of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in the basement

In the basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with cl smooth
My man ? ,rob-o, g-r baby pah
The heavster, my brother grap lover
Everybody"
Heavy D,My Love,"Oh,
Baby
What'cha gonna do
Baby
My, my, my love

I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
That was so long ago that I thought 
We could make a new start
You left me broken hearted
From the day your love departed
Now that love you found with someone new is gone
And so you want to come back

What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do without my love
(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna do, baby)
What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do
Now that my love has gone away from you

Sweet memories of yesterday 
When it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, 
Holding you tight
I wish you know that a woman
That you learn to leave today
And it's a shame that you want to come back now baby
My love has gone away

What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do without my love
(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna do, baby)
What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do
Now that my love has gone away from you

I played the fool for you baby
And you stole away my heart
(What'cha gonna do)
Now that my love is gone away
(What'cha gonna do)
Sweet memories of yesterday
(What'cha gonna do)
Now that my love is gone away

What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do without my love
(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna do, baby)
What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do
Now that my love has gone away from you
What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do without my love
(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna do, baby)
What'cha gonna do without my love
(My love)
My love
What'cha gonna do
Now that my love has gone away from you"
Heavy D,Don't Curse,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
Does she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be	-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'm a let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

(Free Slick Rick)"
Heavy D,Now That We Found Love [Club Version],"Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 
Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up Rev me up 
My little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not
Here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', Bubblin' overweight lover hurt prone
So what's it gonna be
Me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch
Stretch for a sec.
Shake me, Shake me
Baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am
Come on and take me
Wind your body
Baby move your body
I see you slip sliding
Come on now do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling Hunky Dory 
'bout this thing that I found

Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 
Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 

I dig the way you wiggle
You don't jiggle 
Once you jiggle
So hand over your love
Cause it's heavier
Than it'll 
Move like a Mover
Sye wanted to groove 
So I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn
So we'd be schoolin'
So I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb)
But not like this
We can waltz and turn 
Rumble tumble and twist
Then you think you gonna give in
Phantasies relivin'
So lay down and relax
Lover my lady
Lady love of my baby girl
Spread your wings
So we can fly around the world
When you drop me kisses 
You're so cute you drop the bomb on me
Stretch it 
Stretch it
Flex it
Flex it
Gimme the permission
Okey, Dokey
I'll bless ya
Blessin' like buddha
Buddha as the bless
You can lay down on the Lover
Put your head on my chest

Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 
Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. 

What can we do
What are we gonna  do
Roses are red and Violets are blue
Love is good and plenty
If you get plenty good lovin'
Do me right
Do me right
My lonesome dove
Tell me one more time
What is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure
As to what is going down
But I'm feelin' Hunkey Dory
'Bout this thing that I found"
Heavy D,Let It Rain,"[Chorus]
I don't want to go outside
I just want to be with you
I don't feel like takin' a ride
You know what I want to do
Girl you makin' me sweat
Come close
Let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

Let it rain 
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and 
Here to move a million plus
Cause when I'm damp i don't rust
Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course 
So precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto
Snuggle
Better yet
Cuddle
Happy like a little kid 
Playin' in a puddle
Of H2O
A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover 
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus] 

Now we can go down stairs
Strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing 
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One two three
Hey yo who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D.
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus

Okey Dokey
Lookin' for a trophy
Giggolo, Romeo
Wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like preacher
Your high school teacher
Just call me your daddy O
Loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid 
But drive a jeep 
not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Before you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin' with the lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden  
I got the tingle fro a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a Pringle
I think I like to mingle 
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see 
how it would be

[Chorus]

Lightning and thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid 
'Cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control
Who needs a grammy 
When you know you got soul
I'm a smooth
Yella
Complexion
Vanilla
High Low
Aphro 
Intelligent fella
You look worried
Does something trouble ya
We can take a ride in my
Heavy D M W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can 
Gimme what you want 
And show me what you got
But for now 
Just snuggle me Snuggle me
Quit the chit chat
Double up and snuggle oven me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see how it would be"
Heavy D,Peaceful Journey,"Here's to you
You have gone through struggles, suffering
This one goes out to everybody in the world, but especially on the street level
Because I know where you comin' from and some of the things you do, I can understand
So through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

What is a friend for? Through rich and through poor
Kinda like a marriage balanced on a different floor
A friend could tell you things that he wouldn't tell another
So in essence, a friend could be considered a brother
You laugh and you play a lot, you talk and you say a lot
But when it's time to feel the pain, you cry and you pray a lot
I'm talkin' about you, you who have the time
A time to be my friend when no one else would be mine
Problems were nothing because I had my man to share them with
Hills were nothing neither, cause I had my man to climb 'em with
I'm really proud to say that I truly really knew you good
And oh, God's blessing from the entire neighborhood
And as the days drift, drift into the future
I laugh a little louder at the times that I was witcha
This one's for you and I truly hope you hear me
And through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x2] 
You'rrrrrrrre on my miiiiiiiiiiiind (You're on my mind)
And I wish you a peaceful journey (Peace!)
Brother I hope you hear me

In the corner, sits the little girl in tears
The shadow of a man overwhelms her fears
""Mommy, mommy, NO!"", the words of a battered child
The wicked, wicked mommy has the sticks swingin' buckwild
""Mister, mister, do you have a dime?
See, I'm hungry and I'd rather be a begger than do crime""
Sure here's your dime, go make a big ten bucks
Now sneak around the corner, get your joints and go beat him up
A kid on the streets, doesn't want to be beat
So he hangs on the block 'til his pop fall asleep
Missing kids on the milk carton
A lunatic kills kids for kicks and gets pardoned
Baby girls run away from home, huh
And two months later, they're stars on child porn
Tracks on the arms of a minor
Suzie ran too, but she'll be dead when they find her
Kids on the street movin' drugs, the thugs' growin' up fast
Wouldn't stop when one gets plunged
Junior stole a Benz with his friends
But got caught, now he's doin' time with twenties and tens
For the rest of his life, he learns to lean on the wall
And prays for the day when his number is called
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x2]

Pardon me, mister warden, I'm askin' for a pass
To come for some of my brothers who made mistakes in the pass
It's really not their fault, you see times are hard
And it was probably difficult for my man to find a job
Before he was forced, forced to make a living
By lying, stealing, and eventually killing
No one was born bad, we're all God's Kids
So who's to really blame for the wrong that he did?
And speakin' about the law, what are they for?
To beat us with a stick face down on the floor?
You preach and you preach that you want crime to stop
If you want crime to stop, stop hiring crooked cops
So hear me brother man, hear my plea!
If you want success all you gotta do is succeed
Love, life, pain, death
What else is left on the travels of life's steps?
In life, we lose, get bumped and bruised
The road you choose not necessarily a cruise
You giggle for joy, shed a tear for pain
There's a lot to lose, and a lot to gain
Though when you walk on the streets, try to walk on street smarts
When you see your man down, try to have a little heart
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus x4]

Yeah, you're on my mind
Peace
Hear me now brother

Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your stealing, stop your stealing
Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your killiiiii-ehhhhh-eeeeaaasah
Huurrrrrrrr 
Who!

Take my hand, take my hand
If you need somebody, you can trust on me!
Ha, you can lean on me
Yes, you can errrr-aaaaahh-yaaahyaah"
Heavy D,Letter To The Future,"Intro (spoken):

People, 
The world today is in a very difficult situation,
And we all know it,
Because we're the ones who created it.

Chorus:

What's wrong with our future? (4x)

Verse One:

Bust this

How long will this last?
A friend to the end, a memory in the past
You think you're big, cause you walk with a shotgun
I got new for you, your days are numbered, son
Why don't you get yourself a job?
When your kid grows up, do you want him to rob?
Look at your mother, teardrops
She just received a phone-call from the cops
""Your son will do life, 'cause he wigged a man's wife
Shot her with a gun and stabbed her with a knife."", or
Take a look at your mother's heart torn
She just received a phone-call from the morgue
""Your son is dead from three shots to the head.
The killer left a note and this is what the note said:
""Never be bigger than you are.
 Never try to pose like you're a superstar
 Next time you rob somebody, and you give him the death-wish.
 When you pull the trigger, nigga, don't miss.""
Is this how you want to be
Dead on the street or locked in a penetentiary?
It's cool to be free
And it's alright for you to be you and for me to be me
Look at you, 15 years old
Coolin on the corner with a can of Old Gold
Whatever happened to school?
Yeah, sure you go to school, but you go to be cool
To sport sneakers that you took from somebody
To talk about the kid that you bucked at some party
Life is a gamble, and you're losin
Before it's too late, brother, you better start choosin
Left from right, right from wrong
Or you'll be singin that old blues song
(Yo, you gotta buck em, or else you're soft)
Some I knew thought the same, now they're way up North
You ain't soft, cause you didn't buck a shot
Put the pistol down, throw up your hands, see what ya got
Old Johnny Walker from around the block
Was livin' rather large 'till he got knocked
He had ""Livin' Large"" on his Jeep plates
""Livin' Large"" on his real estate
He even bought a diamond ""Livin' Large"" name plate
He used to look at cops and smile in their face
Drive a BMW and pump the bass
One day, he made a move for a friend
The f-are-iend, the voice said, ""Yo, I need ten."", Johnny said, ""When?""
Later on that day, Johnny went to play the game he normally plays
To do a favour for a chum
You see, a friend is a friend, but then, some are none
Cause when he got to the spot they were supposed to meet
All he found was a police-infested street
I guess havin a friend is rough
Cause now Johnny's up north, doin push-ups, gettin buffed
You see this chain I've got, I've got it, honestly
You see the clothes I wear, I've got it, honestly
You see the Jeep I drive, I've got it, honestly
I work hard, it ain't easy being me
Never had an excuse for life
Just did what I did, now what I do, I do it right
""Jumbo, Jumbo"", they cry on the block.
5.0, 5.0, lay low, here comes the cops
Man, your lifestyle is petro
On your knees again, because Jumbo said so
""Free Mandela"", you cried
But you still sell dope to brothers and sisters outside
Martin Luther King had a dream (ooh yeah)
That's exactly what turned his dream into a nightmare
Malcolm X said, ""By any means necessary.""
He didn't mean just for you, brother, he meant for everybody
Maybe if we were still slaves, we'll be closer; however
Pickin cotton was bad, but we picked it together
I pray for you, and you pray for me
Sincerely yours, the overweight lover, Heavy D

Repeat chorus to end"
Heavy D,You Ain't Heard Nuttin Yet,"Tic-tac, toe'n, three in a row and privilege

How could I explain to ya the Heavmania
Tryna figure eight or make it simple and plain to ya
Hmm, I'm the Heavster, a rap register
That flows with cash so fast you can't measure the
Intent of content that I rep-re-sent
The format of my rap from past to present tense
Girls they adore me, they scream for me
Fellas get jealous cause the ladies won't ignore me

Wreaka, no half-stepper, rhyme veteran
Ripper, Moet sipper, 'cause I'm better in
This hand, even that and, a matter of fact
You wanna know the place to be, the place to be is where Heavy's at
I soar without a fall, 'cause I'm courageously standing
I'm in demand, and on the stage I be better
With Eddie F., he's right back at me
The Boyz are to the left and the right, you know we gotta be

to the next territory, got some people waitin' for me
Get to the spot, drop the top, and then we history
Move down to the Apollo, 125th Street

Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me

The beat is dope, and no note, you can qu-qu-qu-quiz it
The way that I flow, is like an international pro
I'ma let you know, when I go I grow
I flow and blow, to the right tempo
My rhymes are in there, for me it's very simple
I'm the extraordinaire, others they can't compare
to the six foot two half inch light skinned brother with curly hair
An Overweight lovin' machine, the Boyz are my team
My presence is felt, hearts melt like heated ice cream

Grab the mic no setbacks
Come on strong like a blizzard, the microphone wizard
Rather exquisite
Sound check, one two one two
Many are called but the chosen are few
And I've been selected, others resurrected

Move swiftly, stay calm then cool

Heavy D,More Bounce,"One two, one two, one two
I am the Overweight Lover MC, Heavy D
This one goes out to my man DJ Eddie F
Trouble T-Roy my partner G-Wiz
This also goes out to my money earnin Mount Vernon crew
J. Daddy, James Huff, Pete Rock, Nick Love
Trak Boogie, and my man Chris Hughley
(You've got a)

A power, because my temper's at the border
Like I said before, I keep a party filled, like a bucket of water
MC, H-E-A-V-Y D
O-V-E-R-W-E-I-G-H-T Lover in the house, on the smooth tip
And I'ma rip this, then I'ma hop hip
Better yet hip-hop, cause you're a drip-drop
Small as a pebble, while Heavy D's a bedrock
I am the capital, H-E-V rappable
King ambassador with more, who's quite a radical
My style's like particular, extra-curricular
Sit back relax, while Heavy D sticks to ya
a new type of tune'n, risin, boomin
When I need a cut I see Scott, for proper groomin
I'ma go on and flow on and turn my microphone on
then blow on to make sure, the sound is strong!
So y'all get up, keep your head up, and then gear up
Heav' is in the funk, the Boyz in the back will fold the rear up
MC's in my path I'ma steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect with more bounce to the ounce

""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce""

Check it now hip hip hooray'n, check what I am sayin
You'll be happy like a faggot in jail, when Heav is playin
No complainin necessary, cause on the contrary
of bein wack I will react, and others I will bury
I'm comin on STRONG while you stutter we're the (?)
Description of my rhyme?  Hmm, butter!
Better yet milky, smooth and silky
Don't applaud you fraud, you wasn't with me
When I started rappin, you wasn't even tappin
Now that I'm done, you pat me on the back
and say what's happenin, I love the rhymes you announce
Heavy D's in effect with more bounce to the ounce

""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More, bounce.. to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce"" 

Check eight seven six five four three two one
Money earnin Mount Vernon, is where I come from
This rap is an article, started from a particle
Hipped up, hyped up, hemmed up, to be historical
An overweight rubbable, squeezably lovable
Ladies come to me and say, ""Heavy you're so huggable""
Not only am I huggable, but I'm quite enjoyable
When I answer the joint you see I'm rather unavoidable
Plus that means attainable, all my niggaz that's got cable
Rope chains, gold chains, the victory explainable
MC's in my path I will steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

""More bounce, to the ounce"" 
More bounce to the ounce!
""More bounce, to the ounce""

Size; ten and a half, sometimes eleven
Place of rest after death? Heaven
Favorite dessert; chocolate chipcake
Favorite dance mine, the Heavy D Shake
Run, my territory, I will say never
The Overweight Lover, is highly, too clever
Extremely intellectual, not bisexual
If this was a basketball game I'd win the sectional
championship, then eat potato chip
with a little onion dip, and then I'll take a trip
to Maui, Maui is a little island a part of Hawaii
I dip upon the plane push up on the stewardess say FLY ME
You never hear another beat quite like this
Done up real smooth with a lyrical twist
MC's in my path I will steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

More bounce to the ounce!

Here we go again.. here we go!

Me and the cutie on a, cutie stroll
or, me and my crew on the cutie patrol
It really doesn't matter, as long as I get one
and have some fun before the night is done so I
jet upstairs, make sure they're ready
Call Wiz, T-Roy, Nik Dane Chris and Eddie F
so he can bring his DJ set
And collect respect and jet connect
the two Technics as I get the microphone sound check
Now, throw my Nike's on with my Dapper Dan suit
Drop the top on the Saab, and get ready to troop
Pump up the volume on the Benzi, let the music flow
Throw the car in drive, and I'm ready to go
Pull up in front of the joint, all eyes on the Saab
""Damn he's still livin large!"" Aiyyo, it ain't hard..
.. cause here we go again..

Here we go again.. here we go!
Here we go again.. 

Aiyyo, y'all remember this?
Break it down..

Last chapter, I gotta rap ta
this with a twist and if I miss then I'll have ta
throw a tune on, move on, groove on, soothe on
Go to a jam, and prove I'm smooth on
the microphone the throne I own I stand alone
and carry a tone from here to home so
from beginnin to end, now til then
Heavy D's in the house, so here we go again"
Heavy D,Let It Flow,"""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
""And I am MC Heavy D..""
""And I am MC Heavy D..""

The Heavster, measure the pleasure then treasure the note
that I wrote, and you can quote, flow like I row like a boat
Takin a stand, don't need a hand
The man in command did Soul Train, next American BAND-stand
An Overweight Lover discover, no other brother can smother
If I ever fell I'd bounce back like rubber
I'm rough and tough, all that stuff, call my bluff
You can't enough of Mr. Big Stuff, let it flow

""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
Let it flow.. let it flow..
""And I am MC Heavy D..""
Let it flow..

You get your rhyme from a hag bag, you thief from Baghdad
You're soft as a sandbag, throw your rhyme in a Glad bag
The way that you act like, as if you had mic fright
It seem that you're not bright, now I'ma do it right
Get used to a back mark, Lover my trademark
You're just like a hush puppy - no bite, all bark
You move when I say so, I flow when the wind blows
While I'm rippin and strippin you be peakin through a window
Definitely for action, voted for Jesse Jackson
Instead of laggin we coulda been passin
Eddie F on the fade mix, the Boyz with the dance tricks
Dre with the management, Heav' D with the lyrics
Who said that I ain't dope, you're walkin a tightrope
You're livin for high hopes, I wonder what you smoke
Didn't come here to tip-toe, I came here to rip so
grab your partner, dosey-dos.. and let it flow

""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
Let it flow.. let it flow..
""And I am MC Heavy D..""
Let it flow.. Eddie F, breakdown!

{""DJ Eddie F""}
Breakdown, break down like this!
{""DJ Eddie F""}

""And I am MC Heavy D..""
""And I am MC Heavy D..""

All rappers we remain the same, we try, we strain
But still some complain about the fame that we obtain
But I'ma refrain it's insane cause I'ma still gain
You want what's good, but can you stand the rain?
We think hard for what we want, then work harder to get it
But you're too busy tryin to diss us, that's why you forget it
Appreciate what you did, and I hope you keep doin it
But stop riffin, because you just might ruin it
For me, for you, for you and for me
Two wrongs never make a right let's keep good company
You're welcome any night to come on my stage
because divided we fall, together we get PAID

""And I am MC Heavy D..""
So, let it flow.. G-Wiz let it flow
""And I am MC Heavy D.."" 
T-Roy it flow, Pete Rock let it flow
D.O. let it flow, Nick T let it flow
Eddie F let it flow..

Heavy D,Nike,"""Ni-Ni-Nike-Nikes""

N-N-N-Nikes I'm for 'em, out the store I bought 'em
And on the b-b-basketball c-court is where I score them
I'm a, Nike bro I sing SOPRANO acapello
Every, tour that I go, oh no, I won't forget 'em
It's a dangerous thing, never leave home without 'em
Trade in my Nikes I won't even think about it
On my beat the Nike's sleeker, the other kicks are weaker
Eddie F pushes the button, the beat comes out the speaker
The boy can do the dancin, he also does romancin
And when I park my Blazer in my Nikes I'll be p-p-prancin'

[Repeat x2]
""Niiiiiiii-kes"" 

Oh what a relief!
They have red ones, yellow ones, black ones too
White on white, green on white, just to name a few
My crew is fully equipped from ah, the tops to bottom
Everything Nike makes, Heavy D & the Boyz got 'em
So hurry up-ah, run to the store, go get a pair
Guaranteed to be the #1 sneaker of the year
If you're buy yourself, get some for your crew
We wear N-Nikes so you should wear N-Nikes too

""The Nike-the Nike-the Nike-the Nike"" [Repeat x4]
""Niiiiiiii-kes"" [Repeat x2]

What else can I say? (Nike)
We didn't do this cause we had to
We did this cause we wanted to
All we wear is Nike, I sleep with Nikes
Ah-aha-ha-ah-ah-ah-Nikes"
Heavy D,Chunky But Funky [Remix],"Poetically inclined, put in good order
I keep a party filled like a bucket of water
When Heavy's in the house, all the girls go crazy
Fellas that are jealous say, ""Man, you amaze me!""
But all you need is the secret I keep
You grab a girl, gain some weight so she can squeeze the beat
Say ""Hey good lookin"" with the sweetest position
""Get inside the car so I can crank the ignition
You got some trouble, I handle him fo' ya
We cruise around in my BMW""
You got to have the voice to make the people jumpy
I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from three
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin', The Boyz are hop-hippin'
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin'
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin' till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin' all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin' party people performer
Cold gettin' paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide 
From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin'
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin' and rhymin', flyin' and climbin'
To the top where stars are shinin'
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin' is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?) 
I'm chunky but funky

(He's chunky but funky)"
Heavy D,Got Me Waiting,"[Chorus]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kinda digging me
But every time you see me
You seem to be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
I'll catch you the next day

When I focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low profile type

I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Chorus]

I'm standing, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
Yeah, and I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A rubber to get got
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from you, girl, sometime
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the boogie down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus]

Hey, yo, hey, yo
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

I never stumble cause I mumble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
It was your trip
Scared a grip
Because I'm losing it
I did what's clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'm-a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus:Repeat x5]"
